209,B0028C44Z0,1,These just don't do it for me as breath mints,"To me, these are nothing like the regular Altoids and are not breath mints. They are pleasant-tasting little candies in a cute convenient tin, and that's as far as it goes. The mintiness is just not strong, and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis. I'm not a dragon-breath person, but still, one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath. Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while - maybe 15 minutes. At this point, I think the Icebreakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints.",Negativo

452,B000G6RYNE,3,An Acquired Taste,"OK,I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful. I took the plunge as I do like salty, and tangy flavors. No, I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price. They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date  FEB 2011. Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)",Neutral

Other reviewers who bought around the same time that I did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chips.<br /><br />The chips came in a sealed Kettle box, so it's hard to say who screwed up.

I forget; but you get the point.  It's medium-Compleat.<br /><br />Are you just thinking about trying a Hormel Compleat for the first time?  OK, then just remember these reviews on Amazon -- particularly food reviews -- are all simply opinions of customers, no scientific analysis intended (I hope).<br /><br />Compleats are quick, easy (except for pulling the plastic off the top) and generally edible.  There's not a whole lot more to say about them.  I eat them because I'm an old guy living alone and too often I'm just lazy.  These do come in handy for a quick light meal.  ""Light"" depending on your appetite and the size of your tummy.<br /><br />This is a good one to lead off with if you're just now getting into Compleats.

1922,B0016PKA1C,3,"keeps herbs fresh, looks nice--awkward to use","I've had a couple of these for a few years but find that I don't use them all that often because their size & design limits their usefulness. For bushy herbs like cilantro or parsley it only holds a small bunch, and it's difficult to keep the bunch together while you snap the lid back on. Since the bottom cup is so shallow herbs tend to flop out the front unless you lay the pod down when first filling it. It works great for asparagus, but only for small-ish bunches and if the spears aren't too tall.<br /><br />More often than not I simply use a canning jar + 1/2"" of water with a plastic bag over the top, which keeps the contents just as fresh and allows for easier access. These pods do look much nicer in the fridge than a bag-topped-jar, however, and the clear front makes it harder to forget what's in there.<br /><br />They are definitely well made and not prone to leaking or tipping over. And the little drain port is fun to use.<br /><br />But it only works for small bunches.",Neutral
2221,B002C4HZ00,1,False advertising!,The label is misleading. Cento actually sells two kind of San Marzano with the same label other than one that says D.O.P. certified. You will receive the one w/o the D.O.P. if you order from Amazon. I have made the mistake in the grocery store not realizing Cento sells ones are D.O.P and ones that are not and did not realize till it was too late.

2227,B002C4HZ00,3,"False and misleading product data, but they do taste good","The Amazon product info claims they are a certified organic product.  The picture claims DOP certified.  Neither appears to be true.  The cans I received were just ""certified"", and it didn't say by who.  There is no USDA Organic label either.  I also knew all these things before I bought them since they are well documented in the Amazon reviews already, so I wasn't surprised by what I received.<br /><br />On the plus side, they are better tomatoes than I can buy canned in the grocery stores locally, so I'm happy enough with them, and I used reward points from my Amazon.com Visa to buy them, so they were essentially free to me.<br /><br />Would I buy them again?  Maybe.  If couldn't get any of the Strianese D.O.P. certified San Marzano tomatoes, then yes I probably would.  As I said, they are tasty and I do like them better than what I can buy locally, but they aren't the top tomato when it comes to what I can mail order.",Neutral

2466,B002JX7GVM,5,"Lots of flavor, but not too sweet","Coconut Water with a splash of Pineapple<br /><br />This is refreshing!  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  The coconut flavor isn't pronounced, and the pineapple isn't so overpowering that it tastes like syrup.  It's clean tasting.  According to the packaging, ""it has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives.""  There's a smidge of fiber, 0.8 g of protein and 16 g of sugars.  I suspect most of the sugar comes from the pineapple, but ""cane juice"" is one of the ingredients, too. The 8.5 fl oz carton comes to 75 calories.<br /><br />If you sign up for subscribe & save, it's less than $1 per carton.  Actually, the carton is the only thing I don't like about this drink.  It's sort of hard to drink directly from because there isn't any air getting let in when you drink, which makes a vacuum.  This was solved by pouring it into a glass.  *whew*<br /><br />This was good.  I will definitely get more, and I highly recommend this to people who like pineapple juice.",Positivo
2478,B002JX7GVM,3,"Smaller-than-usual package size, overly-sweet taste","My top line advice: If you want coconut water with a touch of pineapple, get the Vita Coco, not this one.<br /><br />Size: The size is 8.5 fl oz per package. I didn't pay close attention when ordering, and expected the larger, 11.5 oz size. Not a big deal, and was my fault, but it's a little too small to be useful.<br /><br />Taste: Ick. I love coconut water. I love pineapple juice. I love lightly flavored coconut water. This tastes like none of the above. The flavor is sickly sweet (ingredients included added sugar), and with none of the nice mellow coconut flavor of other coconut waters I've tried. Might as well be a processed kids drink.<br /><br />Alternatives: While I actually prefer O.N.E.'s regular, unflavored coconut water over other brands, the Vita Coco coconut water with a splash of pineapple is far superior to this one. It comes in a larger package, doesn't have added sugar, has more vitamins and nutrients (this one is diluted with sugar water), and tastes like you're drinking it fresh on the beach. This one is just...not great.",Neutral

One packet does little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHo drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature?  Also, with only 8 packets (the raspberry pom) in a box, that gives you 4 16 oz drinks for $3.

But at least it's edible, unlike every other canned clam chowder out there. If I can find a way to make this taste better than I'd love it. It's the best CANNED clam chowder I've ever had, but it's not that great. The clams taste good.<br /><br />EDIT: I had a 2nd can and I made it today, I added only a little bit of milk and I added NO salt, pepper, or butter, and it actually tastes a lot better than when I did.

It plays hell with my diabetes but I just love creating some delicious dessert for friends when we have small gatherings.<br /><br />I usually buy vanilla beans in Tijuana, Mexico because I can get good quality at a decent price. By that I mean the beans tend to be supple, shiny, and aromatic. By ""decent price"" I mean it usually costs me around $1.50 to $2.00 per piece.<br /><br />When I saw this half-pound package at such a low price I was skeptical but I figured the $25 would not be a big risk and if they were bad I can always return them. I ordered on Jan 11 and got them Jan 13. Free two-day shipping being another great feature of my Amazon Prime membership which I now believe is an excellent value.<br /><br />The beans are very high quality. They are ""Gourmet Bourbon"" which means about 30% moisture (a good thing) and they are shiny and nicely oily (you want the oily surface as that is one part where a lot of flavor is located. The other part is in the seeds and that is the reason the bean is split and the seeds scrapped when used).  These beans are very fresh as shown by their flexibility (as beans grow old they dry out and get brittle- still usable but not as good).  They come sealed in a vacuum bag and that is inside a zip bag. Even through the double packaging the scent is very noticeable and complex.<br /><br />This is a large quantity of beans. If you are not going to use them rapidly I recommend separating into two or three bean lots and vacuum packing those. For optimal shelf-life I keep mine in a wine refrigerator (it gets cool but not cold) where I keep my 20 or 30 pounds of various chocolates.<br /><br />This is an excellent deal on good quality.

In other words this is about as natural as you can get without, you know, drinking real orange juice.<br /><br />The can is also thinner then a soda can so you're not getting as much liquid as you would a Pepsi or Coke.  This means there is less fat in each can, and the makers claim the product is glutton free.  It does have a bit of a weird aftertaste, but after a few sips it stops bothering you.

Despite having ""no added sugar,"" however, there is still 34 grams worth of it in the small 8.3oz can.  Basically, other than having 100% of the daily value of Vitamin C, this drink could easily be replaced with a better tasting orange soda that is in a 12oz can and costs far less.

9987,B000P41A28,2,Read this article first,"2.0 out of 5 stars Read this article first, August 11, 2009<br />By  Pregbaby (Florida) - See all my reviews<br />I thought I was doing the right thing by buying organic and thought Similac was a brand I could trust to be good for baby. That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...]<br /><br />From the article:<br /><br />Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.<br /><br />No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity.",Negativo
10005,B000P41A28,1,Constipation!!!!!,"We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)<br /><br />Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, ""Is my child really constipated?""<br /><br />Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.<br /><br />Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.<br /><br />So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:<br /><br />  * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased ""motility,"" we say)<br />  * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces<br />  * a combination of the above two factors<br />  * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract<br />  o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease<br />  o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation<br />  o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage<br /><br />Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.<br /><br />Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.<br /><br />Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.<br /><br />When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.<br /><br />  The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.<br /><br />The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining.<br />Top<br /><br />Bottle fed infants are ""a whole 'nother story."" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac® that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.<br /><br />The young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.<br /><br />The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting.<br />Top<br /><br />Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:<br /><br />  * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.<br />  * I use a lot of Karo® corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).<br /><br />  Before scolding me about ""the risk of botulism"" from corn syrup, please see:<br /><br />  Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: ""Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember""<br /><br />  ""In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.""<br /><br />  For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.<br /><br />  * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.<br />  * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.<br />  * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)<br />  * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac®, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)<br /><br />Top<br /><br />Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:<br /><br />  * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.<br /><br />  The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.<br /><br />  * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (Karo®, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.<br /><br />Top",Negativo

I wouldn't buy them again, since there are so many similar products which are better.  But they have good points.  Each bar is large, not as big as a candy bar, but close.

11144,B00213ERI0,2,Dry with after taste,"I am in the health food industry and I am gluten intolerant.  I have tried many different GF cookies in the last ten years.

I saw Dr. Oz introducing new foods to some people one day and he reminded them to taste and evaluate on the item, not as a comparision to what they were used too.  That may be why some folks do not like these.  I love these so much I'm buying in bulk.  But I have changed my eating habits 180 degrees so maybe that's why I love them.

One or two cans were delivered with a small dent but the apricots themselves are unblemished. I am sorry the other reviewer seems to have had such a bad experience but I can honestly say that mine were not salty. And the can indicates that no salt has been added. Perhaps it was the potassium in the skins but I think they help intensify the apricot flavors of the pear juice.

If Coffee Bean Direct coffee's are all like this, I won't be a return customer at all.

It truly works wonders.,"I have had seasonal asthma ever since I was a child and have tried rather unsuccessfully to overcome it with excercise, inhalers and medication.  NOTHING has worked as well as Yogi's Breathe Deep tea.  It's like a miracle:  When my breathing is feeling restricted, I drink a hot cup of this delicious tea before bed and it sends me into a nice, deep sleep.  When I wake up, my breathing is 100% better and I feel great for the next 1-2 days.  That's no exaggeration.  I reccommend this tea not only for asthmatics, but anyone suffering from stress, anxiety, lack of sleep, or just anyone who appreciates a good tea.<br /><br />Thank you, thank you, thank you Yogi Tea people!

18022,B008ZRKZSM,3,Great flavor!,"This is a tricky product to review.  On the one hand, the flavor is great! (especially the choc. peanut butter).  If I were rating it on flavor alone, I would give it five stars.  However, I took one star off for the price and another star off for the quantity.  It has 15 servings, with each serving being two Tablespoons.  however, two tablespoons of the powder mixed with a little water only yields about 2 teaspoons of peanut butter.  So if you are making peanut butter for a sandwich or for apples, you go through the jar pretty quick (only took me about two days).  But if you are going to add it to a vanilla protein shake, the one serving adds a ton of flavor.  So I would repurchase this but only for adding to shakes.",Neutral

I love how much more fun it is to give him glucosamine and chondroitin in a treat instead of in a pill or a liquid. These are pretty affordable, too. They also travel fairly well, and they are soft enough to break in half if you only want to give half of a treat.<br /><br />The only possible problem is that I worry about giving my dog too many of these a day. The package does have guidelines for how many treats to give per day based on your dog's weight. But so far ""over-medicating"" has not been a problem (especially if you break them in half).<br /><br />I've been really amping up my dog's walks and runs to get ready for hiking this spring, and so far he's not only limp-free, but the stiffness he used to get just after a nap seems to be significantly reduced.

19569,B000084ETV,1,WARNING -- read reviews--Canidae has changed their formula.,"My husband and I switched our three dogs to Canidae earlier this year based on the many glowing recommendations that I found on the Internet.  Our dogs have done very well on it until recently (we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it's in the 35 pound bags) when they all became ill with diarrhea.  My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks.  After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet!  Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill.  My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula.  Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae.",Negativo

20400,B001BDDTB2,1,Cat Goes On Hunger Strike,"I received two cases of Petite Cusine from Amazon.com earlier this week. I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it.",Negativo

My cat enjoyed this selection okay, but it seemed like he was much happier with the seafood sampler.  This picture on the box looks like something very similar to human food, but the actual contents weren't as close as I had hoped.  I try more and more to buy food that are more natural and less processed.  These claimed to be full of vitamins and 100 percent of the required nutrition.  That might be the case, but my cat sure didn't get all of his nutrition.  Where as he would drink all of the liquid from the seafood flavors, he didn't much care for the abundance of chicken flavored gravies.  The large amount of gravy and small veggies in the Chicken Pot Pie flavor were not to his liking.  He eventually ate pretty much all of it, but not right away - which for a large cat on a diet like my cat - is ultra rare at my house.  He actually begged for something to eat while he still had the rest of the Chicken Pot Pie in his bowl.<br /><br />This food makes some good claims about the quality and I agree the food does look better than anything you get from a local Superstore for 25 cents a can.  My cat is a 12 year old Tabby Manx with some minor health issues.  His well being is important enough that I will buy better made food instead of just cheap stuff... but when it starts going to waste... and at a higher cost to me?  I consider this to be a one time only purchase and do not plan to reorder even if it's on sale.  Nothing against this company, but I think they would do better with a variety pack of 6-8 flavors with only one chicken flavor for every 5 or so other flavors.  If my cat doesn't like it today, then imagine what it will be like in a week when he has had it 7 days in a row.  More than likely most of these cans will go to the dog just so they won't be completely wasted.<br /><br />If you also tried this pack and your cats turned up their noses to it, then I'd recommend the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack of seafood flavors instead if your cat is more of meat-eater than a vegetable / gravy eater.",Neutral

They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".

21940,B000KV61FC,3,Great concept for CERTAIN dogs,"I bought two of these in med/lg along with Smarter Pets IQ Treat ball.  My well mannered collie mix needed company while I ran errands so we adopted a brother for him.  And this husky mix brother needed something ELSE to keep him from destroying my house (they aren't crated.... we tried with the husky but he escaped out of several different crates).  These toys, along with a peanut butter filled kong, are magnificent at distracting them while I'm away.<br /><br />The tug-a-jug is my least favorite.  It is difficult to fill-- filling is easy enough but kibble tends to dribble out as you TRY AND TRY AND TRY to match the threads and close the toy back up.  I can't emphasize how frustrating it is to close up this toy!!!<br /><br />My dogs, while very rough with each other, are not rough on toys inside.  They tend to be mellow.  This toy seems to require a dog who is eager to thrash and bash the toy.  I think my dogs might be more inclined to shake it had I bought the small size.  The med/lg is VERY big.  My dogs are BIG.  Not st. bernard big-- but my husky mix is my tallest dog at 60lbs (frame size is that of my old 95lb malamute, he's just a year old and hasn't filled out yet!) and my golden collie mix is 75 lbs and on the large side for a golden retriever.  Also, it holds LOTS of food.  Since the kibble in the toy is a supplement to their meals I only put a half a cup in it.  I haven't measured how much it holds but it must hold upwards of 3 or 4 cups.  When it is filled less the dog must work MUCH harder to get the kibble out.  I only use this toy when I plan to be away from home for more than 3hrs.<br /><br />They DO manage to empty them by carrying them upside down-- and really only the husky has a large enough mouth to manage this.  They kick some out of it as they would their treat-ball.  It takes them forever which suits my purpose of distracting them from my absence.<br /><br />All in all, it is well constructed.  My dogs would never be able to open this.  If your dog likes to shake his toys like a wolf and his prey this toy might be a wonderful choice.  If your dogs save rough play for outdoors and you plan to provide this as an indoor diversion you MIGHT want to look elsewhere.  And keep in mind the large scale this toy is made on!!",Neutral

But so much of it remained in the package when I tried to use it. Effectively I got about a spoon full out of the package and could not squeeze the rest out.  So I opened the package and licked the insides to enjoy the rest.  It got quite messy.  The taste was okay, but not great, and no funny aftertaste of anything. If I tasted it in the store, I would not have purchased it.  I will eat the rest of the squeeze packs, but I have no plans to order them again or recommend them. To others that feel the need to eat this stuff, I would recommend a bottle and specifically not the squeeze pouches.  I also believe it would be too difficult for a child to use at school, even a middle school child.  With normal items such as juice/toothpaste in a squeeze pack, when you squeeze the contents move away and your fingers come very close to each other.  With peanut butter, you squeeze your fingers but the peanut butter does not move towards the top. So it just does not work well.

It would be nice if the packages were dated so that I know how long I have to use them for best results, and I'm really not sure of how old they are to begin with.<br /><br />So bottom line, I was happy with the taste, but convenience is somewhat diminished because the oil is solid.<br /><br />Added 11/28/11 - I do prefer to use less of the seasoned salt.

The taste is... okay. Nothing to really write home about, and often I feel like it is just too salty for my tastes. The texture also starts to feel rather gummy after you remove the pan from the heat. I do like that this packet makes a small serving - one cup of mix instead of the usual 2-3 cups that a lot of packets have, which invariably gets wasted at our table. There's also no roux/dissolving step - you just toss the water/milk in a pan, mix the packet in, and you're done - and I've had no clumping issues that aren't immediately solved with a little whisking. It's certainly VERY convenient, but I do think the taste suffers a little as a result.<br /><br />I think when these are gone, I'm going to keep trying other brands.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll",Neutral

Yes, I realize these are supposed to be wholesome, but the problem is there are better tasting soft cookies out there that are natural, organic and wholesome. Kashi has better line of cookies that I love. I am not saying that because I am on a health food kick or need to throw out brands that claim to be green and ""whole"".

But, I honestly must say I have found this product virtually unusable.<br /><br />I work for a company where some of the folks add chocolate squirts to their coffee.  So, we go thru a fair amt of chocolate syrup- and thus I have purchased, over 6-9 months, about 3 of the 6-bottle cases of this.  Regrettably, each has been the same- i.e. I'm not just judging the product based on one possibly bad case, or batch.<br /><br />I *do* get a sense of chocolate from this-  !!BUT!! the accompanying odd taste- and the persistent aftertaste, is quite bad.  I've literally mixed this with milk- which has been GOOD milk, and several times not been able to force myself to drink the whole glass- I've had to pour it out- the non-chocolate odd chemical taste of the syrup- EVEN when mixed with milk- was THAT bad.<br /><br />Apparently if you only use a little bit- like maybe a small shot in a cup of coffee- you MIGHT not notice anything different.  But, if you try to taste this directly, or mix it with a reasonably lightly flavored substance- like milk, or water, or, perhaps, cake or cookie mix, I can virtually *guarantee* it will not taste the same to you- it has a VERY odd chemical, sour, bitter, or SOMEthing taste, IMO.<br /><br />Perhaps, if this is the ONLY type of syrup you can use, due to diabetes requirements, or something, you might try it.  However, I would strongly recommend that you look through & try OTHER products first- and use this particular ""sugar-free"" one as a last resort.  Or, if you're determined to try it, go out & find a single bottle in your local store- and try that.  Then, if you *still* like it, perhaps go ahead and buy a case.<br /><br />However, apart from a very special need, I can't imagine why someone would use this.<br /><br />I do *not* think, for example, that even an average person who's concerned about calories, would use THIS.  In fact, *I* am concerned about calories- which is why I tried using this, and stuck with it for so long.  I almost *always* use the low-calorie varieties of foods.

Each bite is far too large for an ordinary house cat, and the directions say ""Treat your pet with 1 to 2 Boost Bites per day per 20 lb of body weight.""  My cat weighs much less than 20 pounds, so I cut one of these up into quarters.<br /><br />Well, I tried, anyway.  They don't cut, they crumble.  They seem to have a texture like a fibrous insulation I'd used for soundproofing.  I picked a piece out of the crumbs and dust and fed it to my cat.  He swatted at it a few times then swallowed it whole, even though it was twice as large as his usual treats, which he normally chews.  He wasn't interested in more.  I scooped together a pile of crumbs, added a couple of drops of water, and molded them into a lump.  Wet, he loved it, first chewing up the lump then snuffling up the escaped crumbs.  Right now he's trying to convince me that more testing is needed.<br /><br />The packaging hints at mysterious and wonderful benefits, but I'm a bit doubtful.  It suggests:<br /><br />""Instinct Raw Boost Bites may help promote:<br />*Vitality & energy<br />*Digestive health<br />*Lean muscles<br />Give your pets Instinct Raw Boost Bites and boost their health with the purity of raw food.""<br /><br />The raw ingredients, after chicken and turkey parts, include fruits, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, montmorillonite clay, lettuce and spinach, and dried kelp and sprouts, among other things.  The package goes on to claim:<br /><br />""Our purpose is to empower people to transform the lives of pets.  Freedom from allergies, improved skin & coat, weight loss, reduced incidence of ear infections, and healthier teeth and gums are just a handful of the amazing pet transformations that Nature's Variety customers experience.""<br /><br />If there's an amazing pet transformation I'll update my review.  Personally, I'm hoping for an amphibious vehicle, but I'll settle for a dog.<br /><br />These are too large and messy, they require added water to really get the cat interested, and this is a pretty hefty price tag for high maintenance treats, but he does seem to like them once they're wet.",Neutral

One look at them from my all-too-human perspective and I had a whole new scale by which to determine how important my art as a reviewer really was to me.<br /><br />Be that as it may, I found the reactions of the three cats I gave these to a surprisingly mixed bag.<br /><br />One, the finnickiest eater that will do anything for a piece of Salisbury steak half the size of your pinky, ate one whole one (which I had to break into quarters) and lost interest halfway through the second one. The second one sniffed at a piece exactly once and walked away, while the skinny and freakish third one that never liked me (they're my roomate's cats, not mine) had a reaction that, translated into words, would have been this more or less:<br /><br />""Hmmm... I see you have that. What is that? interesting... aroma, yes, the word is aroma... intriguing... perhaps even enticing...<br /><br />Where did you get it? Give it to me. Give it to me now!<br /><br />Hmmm... Yeeeeees...<br /><br />You have more, don't you? Good. Give it to me! Give it to me now!<br /><br />[chewing] Yes. I'll submit to your petting me while I eat it (Stay away from the neck!) and maybe, I say *maybe* afterwards if you have a supply of these and can provide me with more of them.<br /><br />[more chewing} You know, I never liked you, not really, not before, but now I see you're really not so bad a fellow after all...""<br /><br />So there it is. A temporary hit. A great big hit and a definite miss on three housecats. They're somewhat expensive for pet-treats but, with the right cat, you could use them to try and teach the basics like, ""come when I say your name"" and ""hiss at someone else.""<br /><br />As far as dogs are concerned, this is going to have to wait until I can overcome the idea of how a stranger might react to my approaching him or her and saying, ""Hey, you don't know me. I don't know you, but I still want to feed this to your dog.""<br /><br />More about that after I get some time to screw up my courage.",Neutral

However, it has pin-size holes for drainage, and doesn't seem to work well with small seeds.  I am mostly making broccoli sprouts and alfalfa sprouts (small seeds).  Probably the Sprout Master would work fine with sunflower seeds, nuts, beans, wheat, or other seeds that are at least as large as a mung bean.  What happens with the small seeds, such as the broccoli sprouts, is that they grow their roots through the holes, and their roots make a thick mat underneath.  So then it is very hard to remove the entire sprout.  The roots break off, so then we have only the tops of the sprouts.  I'm able to scrape the roots off of the backside and put them in the salads too, but it's just not as nice as the whole sprout unbroken.  I don't have this problem with my other sprouting system, the Tompson & Morgan Seed Sprouter - Two-tiered (also available at Amazon).  It works so much better because it has slots instead of pinholes.<br /><br />The broccoli sprouts don't make a mat of roots underneath the tray with the Tompson and Morgan Sprouter.  They just make sprouts like you would see in the grocery store.  I've also noticed that my sprouts grow much faster in the Tompson and Morgan Sprouter.  I've done many comparisons, and it always is like this.  I am not sure why.  So, all things said, I wish that I hadn't bought the Sprout Master Triple Sprouter.  I would have bought several more Tompson and Morgan Sprouters instead.  They look very attractive and are a lot easier for me to deal with than the Sprout Master.  I'm sure the Sprout Master is great for people that are using the larger seeds.  Maybe I will start doing some larger seeds/nuts/beans too, but my main interest is with broccoli sprouts, alfalfa sprouts, radishes sprouts, etc., all of which have tiny seeds.<br /><br />The other thing about the Sprout Master, as others have noted, is that it's a bit difficult to clean small seeds out of the holes.  You have to use the tip of a paperclip to poke stuff out sometimes.<br /><br />Once again the Tompson & Morgan is so much easier -- with their slots instead of pin-size holes, the seeds and other stuff fall right out during a quick wash and rinse.  No paperclips and poking needed!<br /><br />And the Tompson & Morgan has gone through my dishwasher many times without harm.  Sprout Master says don't put theirs in dishwasher, so I have not.<br /><br />By the way, if anyone has some ideas for how I can make the Sprout Master work better with my little seeds, I would love to read your comments.

I'm a take it or leave it consumer and in general, I go for the good stuff.  This sample bar was my introduction to the Newman's Own Organic Chocolate line, and in order to get a variety of opinions, I shared this taste with several co-workers.<br /><br />My immediate impression was that the bar had the nice, crisp snap of well-tempered chocolate, and also that it had a lovely texture, melting quickly and smoothly in my mouth.  The ""dark"" chocolate bar has a slightly smoky flavor, but only 54% cocoa, which is less than what many may be looking for in a dark bar.  (Newman's Own also has a super dark bar with 70% cocoa.)  All of us felt that this bar was sweeter than we would have ideally preferred, more akin to bittersweet chocolate than a true dark chocolate.  It was suggested, for that reason, that it might be a nice high-quality bar for baking--though as noted previously, it is not a standard baking bar size.<br /><br />The other thing that all of us noticed was a very subtle orange note to the flavor, to the point that we searched the ingredients for an explanation.  The ingredients of this organic bar are very simple and straightforward.  In fact, there are only five, none of which would explain this undertone.  And it wasn't a problem, overt, or unpleasant; it was simply commented upon.  Further perusing the Newman's Own offerings, I see they produce a dark chocolate orange bar, and I have to suppose there is some minor cross ""contamination"" of the flavors.  Mystery solved.<br /><br />A quick survey among my cohort revealed that there was only one of us who really cared that the product was organic.  Yeah, the rest of us are Philistines.

I thought the ""buttery"" description was just ad copy when I first got them, but something about this olive variety really is more hearty and buttery than the typical martini olive.

They are not extremely salty, which makes for nice, trim ankles, and the chocolate is of the kind that does not contribute to FAT (which I have too much of thank you very much). So they are worth a try :)",Neutral
44617,B001EQ55RW,4,Thes things grow on you...,"When I bit into my first chocolate covered almond I was a bit surprised. The baked in chocolate reminds me as if the nuts were dipped in Nestles chocolate powder. I wasn't' ready for that. I actually didn't really like the texture, and the taste wasn't that great... but I kept reaching back into the can for more. Now I really like them. The almonds are nice and fresh and the subtle chocolate taste just adds to the enjoyment. They are NOT chocolate covered in the traditional sense - if you want candy, these won't do. But for an interesting snack, these will satisfy your chocolate cravings,as well as let you have a great snack without a lot of calories, get some cocoa roast almonds today!",Positivo
44810,B001EQ55RW,2,Not That great.,"While the Almond taste is on point, the chocolate taste is not. They were pretty much just plain dry roasted almonds with Cocoa powder mixed with Splenda sprinkled on them. I could only really taste the chocolate with my first bite. After a few bites, All I could taste is almond. The light chocolate taste was just a little too light for me. And for someone who eats chocolate like it's becoming extinct, this is a bad thing. Plus, the chocolate powder was very difficult to remove from my hands.<br /><br />PROS<br />1. Great Almond Flavor<br /><br />CONS<br />1. Just a hint of chocolate - for others this may be a pro but for me, EH, not such a good thing<br />2. Coated in a messy chocolate powder. - It's Best if you have mouth to canister contact when eating these.<br /><br />To sum it all up, I've had better.",Negativo

I was sure it would taste as good as it smelled and never even thought about adding a sweetner. The first sip was awful....it didn't taste at all lemony like it smelled. I can't identify the taste but do know my mouth and throat felt an unpleasant,almost stinging sensation. So, I added some sugar. The second and third sip were slightly better, but the stinging sensation was still there and the aftertaste did not go away quickly. The rest of the drink went down the sink drain....it was definitely not my cup of ""tea"".",Negativo
45723,B0041NYV8E,3,Nice Ginger Drink...,This was a pretty good drink however I barely taste lemon.

The first thing I noticed when I opened the bag was the amazingly strong ginger fragrance - it was so strong it was off-putting. I got my first whiff of lemon once I added the water. After stirring it up the fragrance mellowed a bit.<br /><br />The first sip was reminiscent of when I was on a juicing fast (fruits and veggies only) when I used Ginger in a drink recipe that I read online. It was strong and had a terrible after taste. This was exactly that. At first you can taste the lemon, and then you get the spicy kick all the way down your throat. I tried a few more sips to see if I could acclimate my taste buds but I just couldn't hack this. I'm just not good with ginger in my drinks.<br /><br />If you want something spicy (and especially ginger) and you enjoy flavors from the Far East you may enjoy this drink. It's natural and the ingredients are good for you. It just wasn't for me.",Negativo
45800,B0041NYV8E,3,Bitter!,"Everyone's taste is a little different, so let's try looking at this more logically by breaking down statements from the official description:<br /><br />=========><br />Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix is made from top grade ginger and honey to give a unique taste, providing goodness and fragrance when consumed. Enhanced with tangy natural lemon flavor,the taste is certainly refreshing.<br />&lt;=========<br /><br />It certainly is fragrant. It may not be as good as burning a lemon-scented candle, but it did give a fresh, lemony smell to the area -- better than lemon-scented cleaning products.<br /><br />But I couldn't *taste* the lemon. There's an undertone of sourness, but bitter ginger dominates. The honey apparently keeps it from being too bitter. It does NOT have any sweet flavor.<br /><br />And actually, the bitter flavor reminds me more of black pepper than it does ginger.<br /><br />=========><br />Traditionally, ginger is used as-a spice to flavor food, however, people from many countries around Asia e g. India, China, Indonesia, etc, consume ginger products for motion sickness, to aid digestion and to restore the balance in the body. The inner foil envelope contains instantly dissolving crystals that make a spicy beverage. You can control the depth of favor by how much you add to you cup.<br />&lt;=========<br /><br />While it is strong, I'm not sure making it weaker by adding more water does any good. You either like the flavor, or you don't. I suspect I would like it better if I had a cold, as this stuff really cuts through! It feels good in my tummy, too.<br /><br />But, again, this is not a ""refreshing"" beverage. This is a slap-you-in-the-face bitter cup of something.<br /><br />The crystals did dissolve instantly when the hot water hit them. There was nothing to stir. No sediment.<br /><br />My first reaction was, ""This is horrible,"" but I decided to sally forth, and drink at least most of the cup before making my judgement. It did grow on me, but not enough that I'm likely to buy it. It's just not my cup of tea.<br /><br />But if you like a bitter mix of ginger flavor (that I still think in this case tastes more like black pepper, even though I can smell ginger) tempered with a little sour lemon, and, presumably, enough honey to keep it from killing you, this might be for you.<br /><br />The hotter, and spicier you like your foods, the more appreciation that I'm sure you'll have for this. But if you're looking for a sweatish, lemony beverage that's refreshing in the way that lemonade is, this is NOT something you want to try.<br /><br />eh... maybe I will get a couple of packages to keep around for when I get a cold, and I need something powerful to taste.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is at best an acquired taste. Bitter beyond what most people would call refreshing -- but that may just be what you're into.<br /><br />Edit: One day later, and out of nowhere I have a craving for this stuff. I really didn't like it, so I'm not really sure why I have this craving. Wow.",Neutral

I tried to improve the taste by adding honey and that helped but not enough for me to be able to drink it.  10 minutes after taking a few sips my tongue was still burning from the spices, not the heat.

It had a very appealing color and a strong ginger smell that was very aromatic.  I was really looking forward to trying this beverage.<br /><br />Then, I actually took a swallow, and it was so awful I could barely get it down.  The initial taste is of a nice ginger beverage, but then this unpleasant aftertaste took over, rising from the back of my throat and quickly encompassing my entire mouth.

The PB2 has a definite ""natural"" PB-product flavor, and can be mixed to lend a similar consistency to peanut butter. That being said, I found it is not as fulfilling when snacked on alone, with a spoon.

50732,B006XO7G9A,3,"Same gum, way more packaging","I like this gum, it gets a 5, but here's my gripe.  For some reason they decided to change the packaging, and the changes are really lame.  This gum used to be packaged in 12 blister packs, each having 12 pieces of gum, each blister pack with a cardboard sleeve.  Now it's 16 blister packs of 9 pieces each, again each with a cardboard sleeve, but two of the sleeved blister packs are stuck together. That's right, way more packaging for the same amount of gum.  The claim is ""now 50% more"" because apparently when you stick two packs with 25% less together, you get 50% more.  Sadly, it's the same 144 pieces of gum, just WAY more packaging.  I hope the marketing agency that convinced Wrigley to do this incredibly stupid, environmentally irresponsible thing is forced to move to a landfill and watch as their offices get inundated by 9 piece blister packs.  The only downside to this scenario is that the process will be a third faster than if they had just left it alone, putting them out of their misery sooner.  By the way, have I mentioned that there's WAY MORE PACKAGING?",Neutral

The price here, if for only 1 package is ridiculous. Twentyfive? Ten is more of the standard pricing.  I believe BBB offers free ship online for single serve coffees like this, too.  Tassimo often does sales and always does free ship over 50 buckaroos.  If you sign up for emails from Tassimo, they often send out deals and sales on their stuff, too.<br /><br />There were a couple of cons, though.

But these Training Meals from Plum Organics are a notable exception. We tried three different varieties (Pasta with Chicken and Vegetables, Harvest Vegetable with Turkey, and Multigrain Super Greens), and so far, we're zero for three. My son's most favorable reaction was to the Multigrain Super Greens, which he ate, but begrudgingly so, with wrinkled nose and other negative facial expressions. The other two, well... He alternated between pulling faces, emphatically pushing away the spoon, spitting the food out and, on at least one occasion, actually gagging. I'm disappointed. We've loved this brand's fruit and vegetable pur&eacute;es since my son started eating solids, but he's old enough now that he needs to be eating more proteins and more textured foods, and I really thought these would fit the bill.

Some may want to add sweetener to it in an effort to balance the flavor. I personally found the coffee tastes much better over ice with added sweetener.

65554,B001EQ55ZO,3,"Should Be Called Onion, Sea Salt, & Pepper Cashews","This is the second type of nuts that I have tried from Emerald with the other being the Cocoa Roast Almonds.  While the almonds were a sweet and salty snack, these are salty and spicy.  As with the Almonds, the lid measures a 1/4 cup serving of nuts.  After eating these for a few days, here are my impressions.<br /><br />As you can tell from the headline, these didn't turn out to be quite what I was expecting.  Granulated onion is listed on the ingredients along with ""spices"", but the onion flavor comes through rather strongly with the salt and the pepper.  While the taste grew on my pretty quickly, I found that these made me very thirsty.  Compared to the 25 mg of sodium in the Cocoa Roast Almonds, these cashews clock in at 270 mg.  The almonds also win with 210 mg of potassium versus only 140 mg in the cashews.<br /><br />In the end, though, the taste is what is going to make or break this product for most people.  What you need to know is that the flavor of these cashews is very strong, and it doesn't come from the cashews themselves.  If a strong salt, pepper, and onion flavor is what you are looking for in a snack, this will be right up your alley.  For me personally, they are something that I wouldn't turn down if someone offered them to me.  However, I probably won't go out of my way to buy more of them.

The salt and pepper combine for an irresistible, slightly hot combination that's hard to put down (if you have plenty to drink, of course).<br /><br />Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashews come packaged in the kind of handy plastic cylinder with a sturdy lid that my grandma would wash and use to store sewing supplies.

67331,B004JRXZKM,2,Not great for first time dieters or non-vegetarians,"To like this product you really have to NOT expect to taste an actual noodle. There's no dough taste, no noodle texture, etc.<br /><br />The ""pasta"" part really only comes from the fact that they're cut into noodle-like shapes but that's where the similarities end. Do not listen to any of the reviews that tell you this tastes just like real pasta- it doesn't. At all.<br /><br />First off you need to not be sensitive to what the noodles initially look and smell like. When you open the bag you will be hit with a horrible smell that I'm told is the water it's packaged in more than anything else. If you drain the noodles and give them a quick rinse off in cold water you'll get rid of the smell pretty quickly. Also, the noodles themselves look and feel like squishy, raw calamari right out of the bag. That and the smell certainly doesn't help get you hungry but again, rinse it off and you'll get rid of the smell.<br /><br />After that you really need only drop the noodles into some boiling water for a minute or two to cook them and you're good to go so really the longest part of preparing the noodles is boiling the water and/or cooking whatever else you plan on adding to it.<br /><br />The best way I can describe the texture is that its like the pink pieces of ginger you get with sushi but obviouly without the same flavor. The noodles themselves are relatively bland so theoretically they should take on the taste of whatever sauce you cook it with but I didn't find this to be true. It's a weird texture, to be sure, but the noodles don't have much of a taste on their own so I can't really say the taste bad.<br /><br />If you're a vegetarian or a vegan who is used to eating ""strange"" things, tofu, etc then you might love this product as it definitely has that kind of feel to it. If you're a pasta lover this is nowhere near as good as real pasta and if you're a low-carb dieter looking for a way to cheat and get a pasta fix I think you'll be disappointed with it. Still, they're relatively healthy and relatively inexpensive so they just might be worth a try if you're looking for a pasta alternative just be warned that it doesn't taste like pasta.<br /><br />I would never order this in a restaurant and I won't be purchasing them again but if I went to a new girlfriend's mother's house for dinner and she served these up I would be able to eat them without a problem :-)",Negativo

67642,B007OXJK3Y,1,Attention Chocolate Connoisseurs: Avoid Like The Plague!,"I should start off by saying that I have never understood the appeal of artificial chocolate flavoring.  Even when I was a kid and a total junk food junkie, the things that were artificially flavored chocolate always tasted strange.<br /><br />Fast forward to my life as an adult and I find that neither has the technology behind artificial chocolate flavoring improved, nor my opinion of it. It still has a subtle (and sometimes, not-so-subtle) metallic taste and an obvious artificial one. So do many artificial flavorings, but most seem to replicate the real thing about 75-80% of the time. Not so with artificial chocolate.<br /><br />So then, it will come as no surprise that this K-Cup variety is equally disappointing. Imagine the most mass-produced chocolate doughnut with a laundry list of ingredients (and unpronounceable ones at that) and one pretty much has the taste of this coffee flavor---at best.  It's not the worst chocolate flavored coffee I have ever had, but when most are pretty bad, that's not saying much.<br /><br />For the life of me, I can't understand the reviews of other incarnations of this product which claim that it's ""like licking the frosting off a chocolate donut"" or ""tastes like adding chocolate syrup to your coffee"". No, and no!  It's also a far cry from ""cafe mocha"", as well.  Come to my house and I will make you a K-Cup of coffee with real chocolate and you can have a far superior cafe mocha experience.<br /><br />It tastes little like a doughnut, a chocolate doughnut, and nothing like chocolate doughnut glaze and marginally like chocolate at all.  If you are a fan of products from companies like Ghirardelli or Lindt, I will guarantee that you will be disappointed at best and disgusted at worst.<br /><br />I received this flavor as part of a sampler from the manufacturer's [GMCR] mail order program, and fortunately only received one K-Cup, as I would never place a full order for this flavor.

69951,B00032BG3K,5,DID I FORGET TO MENTION? -- IT TASTES GOOD TOO!!!,"""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" is one of the healthiest and tastiest foods you have available at your local grocery. When you read the label, you see a lot of nutrition and few calories for just 2 tablespoons. But much of what wheat germ has is not on the label. For instance, it promotes gentle regularity and is an excellent source of chromium, selenium, and other trace minerals. It is also a balanced package of protein, carbohydrates and fat, without saturated fat. It promotes heart health and provides an energetic feeling. Mixed with vitamin C, some people use it as a very effective antihistamine without side effects.<br /><br />Since 1982, I have incorporated ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" into my daily diet. The easiest ways to achieve this are as follows:<br /><br />1] Adding to cold cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, soups, homemade bread, puddings, macaroni and cheese, applesauce and literally anything you want that has sufficient moisture.<br /><br />2] Substituting wheat germ for bread crumbs in meatloaf, veal/ chicken cutlets, or any fried batter.<br /><br />Kretschmer's Wheat Germ comes toasted in a vacuum-sealed bottle which makes it a very stable and fresh product. It even has an expiration date printed across the top of the bottle in plain sight. Raw wheat germ from the health food store tastes awful, turns rancid sometimes before you buy it, and is usually poorly packaged.<br /><br />This ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" gets a 5 for nutrition, ease of use, packaging, and value which makes Kretschmer's Wheat Germ hard to beat. Oh, I forget to mention --IT TASTES GOOD TOO!<br /><br />DOWNSIDE: This 12 ounce package costs only $1.00 less than the 20-ounce package and should be passed by when the 20-ounce size is available.

I turned the package over and sure enough, one of the listed ingredients was sucralose, which is found in Splenda.  I think the label is a bit misleading because it gives the impression that only honey is used to sweeten the product which is not the case.  The box says it does not contain aspartame, which is true, but sucralose is not much better for you and still has an artificial taste.  I didn't like this so I wouldn't buy it again, and truthfully, I would rather buy this product if it was sweetened with ONLY honey or real sugar, even if that meant it had more calories.

After I shampoo, I add conditioner, comb it through with a wide tooth comb and then put my hair up in a clip with the conditioner still in my hair, while I wash my body. So, conditioner always sits in my hair for a good 5 minutes or so. With this conditioner, I felt like I had to use so many heaping piles of it to get just a tad bit of detangling action. Once I rinse it out, it almost feels like I never even used conditioner. Most of the time I use my other conditioner (Infusium23 or Redken Extreme) after rinsing this Clear one out.

It actually seemed like my ends might be slightly drier than normal (nothing a little shine serum couldn't fix). My hair felt very clean the first week, but my scalp has started to become oilier than usual (sometimes at the end of the day, my scalp looks like I haven't shampooed for two days).<br /><br />In terms of chemicals, this shampoo is too new to be included in the Environmental Working Group cosmetic database, but the biggest issues are the fragrance (parfum) and the DMDM Hydantoin.

It's hard to describe, but years ago, Clairol's after-coloring conditioner had it, as did Pantene.  (I sniffed the latter in the market today -- like Clairol, it no longer contains that odor.)<br /><br />To be fair to Clear Scalp, I'm an extreme overachiever when it comes to having a picky nose, but my encounter with this particular product ended with me popping a sinus pill and a couple aspirin after getting a dab of shampoo on my hand.  (I rinsed it off quickly but the odor clung to me for hours, faint but twinge-inducing if I got my hand near my face.)  Consequently, I didn't dare use it or the conditioner on my hair.  I'd have to give it one star.<br /><br />My husband, however gives it four stars, knocking one off because he doesn't love the fragrance.

We find this fragrance truly awful (and overpowering), and it completely undermines any concept of ""clear"" or ""pure"" or ""less unhealthy"" in our minds.<br /><br />We'll take a pass on this one and stick with something less obviously scented.",Negativo
71810,B007RTR8AC,3,Good Shampoo - Not Spectacular Specialty,"A couple of months ago I started using the Clear brand shampoos. I began with the ""Strong Lengths"" shampoo and conditioner, and my primary complaint was that it seemed to rob what little volume my hair had. So, I was excited to try the ""Volumizing Root Boost.""<br /><br />I will say that I did see an increase in volume. But, my hair is very fine and I just got it cut pretty short. So, if I didn't see an increase in volume to some extent with this shampoo, I'd call it a flop. The problem I have is that my hair is now more fly-away and less sleek and shiny than it was with ""Strong Lengths.""<br /><br />Here are my primary observations:<br />1. My hair has appeared much healthier (and I have received comments from others to that effect) since I switched to Clear shampoos. That includes both product sets that I have tried.<br />2. I would love to have tried the volume boost shampoo and conditioner set before I got my hair cut, but with short hair I'm not sure this would be my first choice. As much as I hate to use other products for volume, I think that might be the better solution for me.<br />3. I have not tried using this shampoo with one of the other conditioner options, although I did try the volume boost conditioner with the strengthening shampoo. I don't know that I saw much of a difference mixing those two.<br /><br />So, bottom line - I still really like the Clear brand, and I don't dislike this particular product from the brand. I'm happy to have it and use it, but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way, with my hair cut and type, to purchase this product over other Clear products.",Neutral

I didn't have any leakage, but I did pick up a strong scent inside the package, but fortunately it isn't that strong when using the product (strong scents and I do not get along well). The shampoo has a very thick consistency and you don't need much to work up a lather. I've used it about four times now, and while I'm seeing a bit more *bounce* to my very fine hair, I suspect I'd have to use it for a longer period of time to see if there's any improvement to encouraging any growth at the scalp. And therein lies the rub - I don't think this is color safe. I'm at the end of my color cycle and due for a retouch any day now, so a bit more fading wasn't a huge issue, but if I'd just had it done and got that much fading I'd be a seriously unhappy camper.

We used it every other day for a week.<br /><br />In addition, the scent is very strong...and some may find it unappealing.<br /><br />Finally, as at least one other reviewer has noted, the packaging does not hold up well in transit: our sample arrived in a padded yellow envelope via USPS and was leaking all over the place. We thought it was inadvertently damaged during shipping...and disposed of it; Amazon very nicely shipped another one out, but that, too arrived in a leaky mess. This time, we cleaned it off and proceeded to test it out, with the above results. So, if someone does order it online, just be aware that this might be an issue.<br /><br />So, overall, we cannot fully recommend ""CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full"" based on experience, but as with any product like this, it might produce better results for others, so it might be worth a try.

I indulge in an occasional Diet Coke, but have been looking for something to sweeten coffee in the cooler weather and my iced green tea or iced coffee in the warmer months.<br /><br />I brewed a gallon of green tea and chilled it. Since some guests prefer sugar or unsweetened, I normally add sweetener when I pour a glass of tea. The first time, I poured it in a see-thru sport bottle to tote along with me during the day. I added some ""Zero"". It didn't dissolve. I stirred. Still didn't dissolve. I let it sit for a while, still didn't dissolve. Tried sipping it - all of the ""Zero"" was still at the bottom. Shook ferociously. Left on counter for hours, thinking room temp would help. (Nope) Five days later, the ""Zero"" in the see-thru sport bottle, still hadn't dissolved. I eventually poured it out. (As an odd note: It left a white film on the lip of the bottle opening.)<br /><br />So I brewed a 1/2 gallon of green tea and added some ""Zero"" to it while it was still warm. It dissolved. Then I put in fridge to cool.

It tastes okay, and it goes well with tacos to complement the taste.  However, it didn't knock my socks off.  For those concerned about nutrition, 2 tablespoons of the sauce come in at 110 calories.  To me, something that rings up that many calories ought to really blow you away taste-wise in order to make it worth it.  There is a long list of artificial ingredients (which may explain the bright orange color).  The sauce overall is fairly bland, not bold as the label suggests.  Those who prefer spicier, fresher flavors at a lower nutritional price tag should probably look elsewhere.",Neutral
73920,B004JRKEH4,3,Not my favorite - perhaps best used in beef dishes.,"I had the opportunity to sample and evaluate 3 different flavors of Taco Bell's bottled sauces. These were the Jalapeno, Chipotle and Spicey Ranchero flavors. Of the 3, I personally liked the Jalapeno flavor the most with the Spicey Ranchero coming in a close second. The flavors are bold so a little sauce goes a long way.<br /><br />I approached this evaluation from the standpoint that these sauces are condiments, like ketchup or mustard, and not just sauces that you might put on your tacos and burritos. That said, I tasted each flavor on fish sticks with pleasant results. The only sauce I did NOT like on them was the Chipotle sauce, which I feel might be better suited to dishes that include beef. The Jalapeno and Spicy Ranchero both work really well with fish (and would be great for fish tacos) as well as chicken. Used as a condiment, these sauces can add a new flavor experience to everything from deli sandwiches to casseroles. I added about 2 tbsp of the Spicey Ranchero to a batch of left over rice along with some cheese and a bit of sour cream to make a great side dish. A lot of recipes that call for mayo might be livened up or rejuvenated with a measure of your favorite sauce.",Neutral

This is deceiving. The pastel orange color masks its true nature: it is essentially a remixed BBQ sauce. The BBQ-inspired taste is so strong that it actually drowns out the chili pepper, garlic, and other spices Taco Bell blended with its chipotle recipe.<br /><br />This product is made to be used with tacos hard and soft. That being said, the reviewer tried it with a ham and cheese sandwich as well as a taco. It made no difference either way. The BBQ flavor will make itself fans or critics based solely on how the consumer feels about the southern staple's fusion into Mexican food.<br /><br />The packaging is clean looking and attractive. The Taco Bell logo is at the top, with an appetizingly loaded hard taco taking up a good 60 percent of the label. My sole gripe is that while the name (chipotle) refers to smoke-dried jalapeno peppers, the sauce has no kick to it. Taco Bell ought to do more market research on consumer preferences for ""bold"" being synonymous with hotness in this style of cuisine. Fans of old school Mexican-American food should pass on the disappointingly one-dimensional Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6).",Neutral

But in all honesty, take a look at the ingredients list and you'll find a few recognizable components and a lot of what I'll term ""chemistry class"" ingredients.

I'm just not sure that you're gaining anything (or losing any inches) by making a product like this part of your regular diet.",Neutral
77104,B001OCKIP0,4,Chocolate granola? Now that's my idea of health food! LOL,"I'll admit right up front that I am not the biggest fan of or authority on granola (most of it is too sweet for my taste and I am not a sweet-for-breakfast kind of person).  I used to eat granola on yogurt--back when I was trying to train myself to like yogurt--but I rarely eat it anymore, so I don't buy granola anymore either.<br /><br />But THIS granola--Back to Nature's Chocolate Delight--intrigued me because I am a chocoholic.  I couldn't imagine eating it as a breakfast food, but I did find quite a yummy use for it--I sprinkled it on ice cream.  I LOVE the flavors of coffee and chocolate together, so I thought sprinkling it on my coffee ice cream (or frozen yogurt) was worth a try.  It was quite a tasty combination and gave my dessert a great crunch factor, which I love.<br /><br />This granola, unlike most, is NOT oversweet.  When I ordered it, I thought the oaty part would be choclate too, but it isn't (or, if it's intended to be, it's so mild that I can't tell).  When I tried the oaty part of the granola with the chocolate chunks that come in it, it had just the right level of sweetness for me.  When I tried the oaty part by itself, it was surprisingly low in sweetness.  The chocolate chunks are dark chocolate (my favorite) and are surprisingly rich tasting--no cheap chocolate taste here.<br /><br />I don't have any other granola here at home to compare the numbers, but my guess would be that this is a bit healthier than many granolas.  According to the package it is ""made with whole grain rolled oats perfectly sweetened with natural ingredients.""  Reading the ingredient list, those natural ingredients would appear to be evaporated cane juice and brown rice syrup.  It is high in calories (220 for a 1/2 cup serving), but I think that is true of any granola.  It has 6g of fat, 2 of which are sat fat, and it has no trans fat.  It has 13g of sugar (which I think is probably lower than most granolas), 4g of fiber and 5g of protein.<br /><br />In terms of eating this granola as a snack by itself, the downside to me is that it is not very chunky.  The majority of my 12-oz. bag was loose oaty bits and chocolate chips...chunks of more than a few oats stuck together were in the minority.  Now, as an ice cream topping, that was a positive thing, but it wouldn't be for snack eating.<br /><br />Will I buy this again when this bag is gone?  Probably not.  But not because it wasn't good and not because it didn't make a great ice cream topping.  As stated, I'm just not that much of a granola person and I really don't need one more snack food laying around the house to tempt me.",Positivo
77130,B001OCKIP0,5,This is the perfect Granola for me,"I ate it right out of the pouch -- it was crunchy, sweet and the chocolate chips (squares) were not overpowering. There were no nuts, no extra crunchy clusters of anything, nothing gooey in it -- just simple and sweet.<br /><br />Then I put some in a bowl and added cold water - little rice krispie-type bits floated to the top but eventually mixed in with the rest of the granola -- it was all very tasty, toothsome, and filling.<br /><br />I put some in another bowl and added hot water -- it tasted more like oatmeal with chocolate chips, and did not have the hot crunchy surprise elements of regular hot granola -- a mild disappointment to me, but no cereal can be all things to all people.<br /><br />The ingredients are simple -- oatmeal, choc chips, sugar, cocoa butter (with 10% saturated fat and 220 Calories per 1/2 cup serving, this is definitely not a low-cal granola -- but Granola has never been known to be low-cal), brown rice products, molasses, Vitamin E.<br /><br />Tasty, and nutritious, and a good source of Copper (15% per 1/2 cup serving).<br /><br />So I like Back To Nature Chocolate Delight Granola best when it is either eaten out of hand or in cold water/coffee/even tea. The pouch is great for long-term storage in a cool place and can go with me wherever I go to give me a good energy boost or just to act as comfort food.",Positivo

The cherry taste is not well integrated with the other flavors; it floats above everything else.<br />* Even though no sugar or other sweeteners have been added, the soda is cloyingly sweet to my taste.<br /><br />A quick look at the Nutrition Facts panel shows why Switch tastes so sweet: one 8.3 oz. can contains 33 grams of sugar (and 130 calories to boot).

This one had sugar added to it so it tasted sweet which makes no sense to me.<br /><br />So I might possibly try this again knowing full well I'd do better just going to a Chinese buffet since that's the closet I will get to fresh crab in Appalachia.

For me personally, I've always stood by the belief that while the dogs are the one enjoying the dog toys and treats, the are more made for the humans than anything else and there is something totally repugnant about a dog eating from a deodorant container.<br /><br />Jilly, my puppy, loved it.  She kept on trying to take it out of my hand and bite at the container until she realized she had to lick but she did love the flavor.  The only real negative is that Jilly got ""liver breath.""  Also the ball in the container didn't spin and I had to squeeze and I got a drip or two on the floor.  I have wood floors so no harm no foul, but if you have carpeting you might get a stain, but Jilly helped with the clean up.<br /><br />But I couldn't quite get over the container and even though Jilly loved it the doggy breath and the fact I didn't like her licking a deodorant container was a big turn off.

For convenience, it is a great product. However, for great barley tea, try doing it the real way with roasted barley seeds... the seeds are cheap (more characteristic of the Korean way)!<br />2.

We've tried everything and the only two things that work for us are full coverage clothing and the dark green spray bottle of OFF Deep Woods Repellent.<br /><br />For these particular wipes, we used one wipe per person before going outdoors.  Mosquito's began attacking us immediately.  We returned indoors to use more wipes in case one wipe per person wasn't enough.  The mosquitos still attacked.

I continued to go out every day for the rest of the week using these wipes and the same thing kept happening no matter how many wipes I used.<br /><br />My youngest is allergic to Mosquito bites so it's a big deal that we have a good repellent.

I offered it to Nellie, who could tell it smelled good and she tried to nibble around the roll-on top not knowing what to do.  I kind of squeezed the bottle and it made the roll-on get flavored.  She then had fun licking it and she seemed to like the stuff.  She's not very picky, so I figured she would.  The smell is not that great.  You can kind of smell it when offering it to the dog.

The stick works like a rollerball, like some of the anitperspirants you see out on market.  When you first open, it does not roll very easily, but eventually it will get going after your dog licks it a few times.  The second major reservation that I have is that if it is being licked, then the part my dog just licked cleaned, saliva and all, goes back into the fluid reservoir which doesn't seem too clean to me. Some may argue that this shouldn't make any difference to my dog who loves licking his hooha and whose favorite appetizer is cat poop, but I cannot help to think that this may be a festering ground for bacteria.

Lightly salted with just a hint of Olive and Garlic. Very tasty and very snack-able.<br /><br />The one-ounce bags, though they may at first glance seem packaging intensive, are a good idea.

96422,B001KUULNU,1,Unfortunately Awful Taste/Texture,"I bought this after reading the nutrition information. If it tasted good, it would be a wonderful breakfast, especially on the week-ends or you could even use it as a dinner entree because it has only 2 grams of fat/serving, 5 grams of fiber and 10 grams of protein. Unfortunately this mix tastes ghastly and the texture of the pancakes is kind of ""pebbley"" and just not what I've come to expect from a pancake. Also, the pancakes are very fragile and hard to turn. If you make the mix as directed the pancakes are thick and take a very long time to get done and end up too brown. This happened even after I thinned the batter with a bit more milk.<br />And speaking of milk....with this mix you have to add milk, oil and eggs. With my regular mix, I only have to add water or milk and they taste alot better than these do.<br /><br />I thought maybe I could salvage it by mixing it with my usual brand of pancake mix but even at a 40/60 ratio (40 of this mix, 60 of my usual brand) it just tasted awful and again with the yucky texture. Since it doesn't taste sweet to me, I tried mixing it up with some spices, bread crumbs and a bit of flour and dredged a few chicken tenders through an egg and then in the mixture and then I fried them in canola oil. It was not too bad however, it wasn't good enough for me to want to keep this mix or to ever buy it again especially since I almost never fry chicken anymore. One last thing: I read that once you heat flax seed to a certain temp, it looses it's ""goodness"" so I think you probably lose that healthy aspect of this mix.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is too expensive, tastes awful and has a horrible texture.

100123,B000LQORDE,3,Two Tastes - Salt and Red Pepper - yet I like it. Add an egg and it really improves. Unfortunately it is far from healthy,"Don't under estimate the appeal of salt and cayenne (red) pepper for many ""soup lovers"" and reviewers. That includes me.<br /><br />However, this is nothing more than a watery Noodle Soup with lots of Red Pepper and a tremendous amount of salt. Add an egg and it tastes much better. Chop up some scallion and it further improves.<br /><br />There is nothing terribly impressive about this soup YET I like It. This dry soup mix consists of a large packet of noodles (essentially tasteless yet ladened with 500 calories of saturated fats) and two much smaller packets. One of these small packets contains less than a tablespoon of chopped dried vegetables and the other is a ""spice"" packet consisting largely of salt, msg and red (cayenne) pepper.<br /><br />Add some water and you have 2 1/2 cups of soup.<br /><br />Impressions: Beyond the watery base (there are no thickeners), my first impression was that of salt followed ---- after a few more spoonfuls -- of the emerging heat of cayenne pepper. As is typical with cayenne pepper, the heat builds up on the palate over time. Some might call this soup ""medium hot"" but for many I'd imagine they would call it ""very hot"". However, it easy to adjust the heat level - just add less of the salt/spice packet.<br /><br />But the only real tastes here are those of salt and cayenne pepper. The noodles are essentially tasteless and the vegetable packet is so small that it can add nothing more than visual appeal. However, I'll say it again, don't under estimate the appeal of salt and cayenne pepper!<br /><br />This soup can be greatly improved by cracking an egg into the mix and stirring it in during the last minute of boiling. The egg not only adds a much needed third taste but also thickens the soup considerably. I was quite surprised how much an egg improved this soup. Make no mistake - adding an egg really changes the character of the soup.<br /><br />At the [...] I paid - with shipping - for a case of 20 -- this soup was a good value.<br /><br />I'd give this soup 3 or 4 stars with an egg but I'm a bit biased toward anything ""hot"". Maybe 3 stars with an egg is most appropriate and 1 or 2 stars is more accurate for this soup without an egg?<br /><br />HEALTH WATCH: One packet of this soup provides almost 90% of an individual's daily allowance of salt!!!!! That is a stunning amount of SALT. Plus this soup has 40% of the daily allowance of SATURATED fats (thanks to the palm oil used to fry the noodles). With almost 500 calories, you'll be adding a few inches to your waist line if you eat it regularly. It is shame the company choose palm oil to fry its noodles in (presumably to save a few cents) and added so much salt. It makes this soup needlessly unhealthy. It is, in fact, a poster child for all that is wrong with processed foods. I have to add the ingredient list is truly frightening with a long list of chemicals - far more than is typical - even in processed foods. This is probably not a soup anyone should serve more than once a month. View this soup as equivalent to a bag of potato chips, no more or less healthy.<br /><br />Another HEADS UP - some of the reviews on Amazon strike me as a bit suspect: There are a number of 5 star reviews generated by One Time ONLY Amazon reviewers. Once these ""reviewers"" have promoted this company's product - they never publish another review. I've seen this same pattern, time after time, for all the other soups made by this particular company.<br /><br />Finally, everyone should keep in mind how hard it is to believe that any dried soup with a tiny ""flavor packet"" could ever rate 4 or 5 stars among people that have a serious love of soup. Consider too, the simple fact that very few of the soup's ingredients are even readily identifiable as a ""food"".<br /><br />My thanks to the previous reviewers who suggested adding an egg. It made a world of difference<br /><br />THIS SAME SOUP IS SOLD in CASE LOTS OF: 20 PACKAGES, 30 PACKAGES or 40 PACKAGES. ALL OF WHICH ARE LISTED SEPARATELY ON AMAZON. The prices differ on a package by package basis too. Generally the 30 pack, which ships for free, is the better value.",Neutral

Even with throwing out quite a bit, you will still be left with enough good meat to serve at least 6 adults.  If you've never tried heart - give it a go!

This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories.

You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter?<br />The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water).

110249,B001PMC3O8,1,Totally disgusting!,I went back and forth on getting my girls some of the beef flavored Newmans because 2 of the 3 can't eat chicken.  I am always looking for a good quality food to add to their rotation.  There was a pretty good sale on the beef flavored a few days ago so I bought it.  I opened a can to give them for their dinner and I absolutely could not give that to my girls!  It had an awful grey color to it and was the consistency of wall paper paste.  My cats like to chew their food not lick it up so I knew they would have an awful time with this one.  Newman's has changed.  I have tried most of the flavors over the years and I have noticed that the cans are underweight and seem to have almost as much rice as pate in them.

110304,B004867T24,5,I Give This Product Four Paws and A Tail Up,"My girlfriend and I recently rescued four homeless kittens and their mother and have been really having a memorable time getting the kittens acclimated to people. Sadly we weren't able to work with the mother who was completely feral, but we were able to get her spade and then we released her as all of our local shelters were full. Really a tough decision for us, but we did the best we could and by rescuing the kittens, which were ALL female, we figured we probably saved quite a few unwanted kittens from being born and continuing the vicious cycle. Anyhow, when the opportunity to try these kitty treats came along you can imagine our excitement as having four additional mouths to feed can be quite problematic at times and we were excited to get any type of additional food or treats for the little hooligans. Well to put it mildly the kittens absolutely loved the treats and couldn't get enough of them. The only complaint I have is that these treats should either come with a warning sticker or a box of band-aids as the kittens literally tried to eat my fingers when I attempted to give it to them. I guess I should have been a bit smarter and put it on a plate first instead of trying to feed them by hand. I will have to remember that if I ever decide to feed a hungry bear!<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />100% Cat Lover",Positivo

With one pack, I thought I would give extra time but the unpopped kernels just burned, they never popped. The package itself is hard to use and I needed to cut it apart with a scissor before I could use it. Also, and this is the worst, one 6oz package has 900 calories. I usually eat popcorn as a low calorie treat but not this stuff. One person will end up eating the amount that pops and with the calories being in the grease package, all of the grease calories are put on the 2oz that pop. The last few packages I popped, I fed it to my dogs (which usually love popcorn). They had a few bites than left it alone.

I thought it was me just getting used to it, but it is not.  I have become very frustrated with Torani's tampering with and reformulating their syrups.  Even compared to their ""sugar-ful"" syrup, I find that I have to use almost twice as much of this product.  I have found a similar story with other Torani Sugar-Free syrups.  It seems they are making up for the trivial cost of the artificial sweetener and giving you less.<br /><br />As a result, I have been trying many other sugar-free (and sugar-ful) syrups -- and spending a lot, too.  In comparison, Monin O'Free chocolate syrup is roughly 2X as flavorful/concentrated, but sadly, it is about 2X as much cost.  Plus, you may have to pay S/H.  While the Torani flavor is pretty good (slight chemical taste), the Monin is a bit malty, so I would give the Torani the edge.  I have also tried DaVinci's sugar-free chocolate syrup.  It probably has the best taste, but like Torani, it is watered down.  DaVinci's is a bit more on the bittersweet side.  At twice the cost, however, it is hard to justify when a bottle only lasts about a week (> $1 per big mug of coffee).<br /><br />Hopefully, others can post what good sugar-free syrups they find.

Typical pods come in individual sealed packets to preserve freshness, but all 12 k-pods in each SFBay box are in a single, non-resealable plastic envelope.  This means that once you've opened the envelope, you're losing freshness faster than usual.

Just woodsy grains and a separate aftertaste of sugar.<br /><br />I tried a bowl with milk.  The texture is interesting, bigger, fluffier and crispier than Cheerios.  Maybe a bit more like Apple Jacks (or how I remember Apple Jacks to be).  To be fair, the longer you let it sit in the milk, the better it becomes.  (Not much.  Just a smidge.)  This is probably because the milk gives it some kind of a flavor.  But that flavor is still not honey nut.  Before the milk sets in, It's bland and a little bitter, kind of like plain shredded wheat, and afterwards it's only slightly sweeter.  The bitterness is still prominent.<br /><br />To be fair, I suppose, I'm not sure what I was expecting.

After getting used to the flavors a bit more, I decided 3-stars was more appropriate.<br /><br />I love tea samplers, trying all these different flavors, typically there are a couple I don't care for and a couple I love. No so with the Chanakara sampler: I didn't like a single flavor.<br /><br />These are caffeine-free herbal teas that have more of a purpose than just being warm and tasting good; each flavor supposedly gives you some benefit. The strength of that benefit undoubtedly varies according to the person (I didn't notice anything).<br /><br />Each tea is packaged in nice two-colored package, telling what that tea is good for. On the tea box it has all the flavors, as well as a chakra chart telling you briefly about the 7 chakras. Each tea bag has the number corresponding to that chakra. (That was pretty interesting.)<br /><br />Missing from the box and the individual tea packages was any kind of brew time. I normally ignore brew times anyway, but I thought in this case perhaps I was brewing it incorrectly... I guess not. From watered-down to a cup of hot liquid seeped for 5 minutes, no matter the level of sweetener, I did not like these teas.<br />The tag on some of the tea bags just says `Chanakara for Mind, Body & Spirit' rather than telling you the type of tea.<br /><br />Red Berry Rooibos, an herbal tea for health & prosperity (Ingredients: Organic rooibos, rosehips, hibiscus, raspberry leaf, ova urea, citric acid, and natural strawberry flavor). I had this tea when I was sick. Didn't smell very good. Tastes like preserved strawberries, but weak. More sweetener didn't give it more flavor. On the other hand (when not sick), drinking it with dried mango made a good breakfast.<br />Vanilla Honeybush, an herbal tea for gathering strength & power (Organic honeybush, orange peel, safflower, and natural honey vanilla flavor). The tea bag smelled really nice, like a dessert, but the taste is icky. Almost like watered-down liquid cheerios.<br />White Lotus, an herbal tea for meditation & wisdom (Chamomile flowers, chrysanthemum flowers, lotus flowers, lotus flavor, and linden flowers). The tea bag did not smell good, but the tea smelled and tasted mostly like Chrysanthemum tea, and a bit like chamomile. It takes some getting used to, then it's not bad.<br />Melon & Green Tea, a tea for love & harmony (Organic green tea, orange peel, jerboa mate and natural melon flavor). Didn't smell very good. If you put a lot of sweetener it doesn't taste bad... but it doesn't taste good. Very dry.<br />Dragonfruit, an herbal tea for passion and creativity (Hibiscus flowers, orange peel, ginger, chicory, damiana, peppermint and natural dragonfruit flavor). If you've ever tasted a dragonfruit, you may find this to be not far off... it's not very good. Let it sit longer and it's OK.<br />Guanabana, an herbal tea for imagination & insight (Orange peel, rosehips, hibiscus flowers, lemongrass, eyebright, bilberry, licorice powder, vegetable juice for color and natural guanabana flavor). It's palatable, but not good.<br /><br />So, sadly, I didn't like a single flavor. I've enjoyed samplers such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQBZRE"">Stash Premium Green Tea Sampler</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQID92"">Stash Premium Herbal Tea Sampler</a>, which I recommend in lieu of the Chanakara tea.",Neutral

136008,B005SPQENY,2,Really Sweet and Syrupy,"This is a review for ChanTea Green Tea and Aloe Vera Passion Fruit flavor.  This is actually the first food or beverage product offered for review by Amazon that I was actually afraid to try.  I did do it however because I made a commitment to review.<br /><br />This beverage comes in a very thin plastic hexagon shaped 11.5 fl. oz bottle.  My product arrived on the first of March and sports an expiration date of 12/25/2012.  The product is made in Taiwan but has Spanish wording on one side of the bottle.<br /><br />I will talk to you about why I was afraid to try it.  First of all because it is made in Taiwan.  I am not too keen on food products that are not USA made but am especially leary of those that are Asian.  I am not sure about their safety standards and won't even eat the packaged tuna and other fish that comes from there.  I put the bottle in the fridge for a good two hours to get it cold as I didn't want to add ice to the beverage before trying it because I wanted to get a true idea of the taste, texture, etc.<br /><br />I shook the bottle up before pouring the contents into a glass.  I noticed these little gelatinous globs as I was shaking.  I poured half of the bottle into the glass.  The mixture was somewhat thick.  Those little gelatinous globs looked really gross and I couldn't bring myself to drink the beverage with them in the glass so I strained them out.  I inspected them by hand in the strainer and not being familiar with the actual Passion Fruit (I have only had Passion Fruit flavored things in the past) I figured they must be the pulp of the Passion Fruit.  They were very fragrant (overly so) but I didn't like the way they looked or felt.  I tasted the drink and it was extremely sweet.  The consistency was very syrupy-like.  The ingredients are as follows:<br /><br />Water<br />Cane Sugar<br />Green Tea Infusion (watered down green tea)<br />Aloe Vera<br />Citric Acid<br />Natural Passion Fruit Flavor<br /><br />Now, in its defense you have to like that the ingredients don't contain HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup) or anything you cannot pronounce.  However, this drink left a really thick coating on my tongue.  I have have had pure Aloe Vera juice before and I really could not detect any of that flavor in this beverage.  I really couldn't tell it was green tea either except for a slight bitter aftertaste.  To me it was really just a sweet Passion Fruit syrup.  I would not call this a beverage as it is not refreshing in any way.  I would consider reducing it in a pan and then pouring it over a nice stack of pancakes.<br /><br />There are 80 calories per serving and the servings per bottle are 1.5 so total calories for the entire 11.5 ozs is 120.  I can think of better ways to spend those beverage calories.",Negativo

The taste is nice, not overly sweet. I like the little bits aloe pulp flowing in the tea. It gives off an interesting texture.<br /><br />Cons: What really bothers me is the sugar content in this Green Tea. It contains 19 grams of sugar per serving x 1.5 servings you are drinking 28.5 grams of sugar, a can of soda has an average of 28 grams of sugar.<br /><br />I dislike products such as this Aloe Vera Green Tea that is made to be disguised as a naturally good beverage to drink yet spike up your insulin levels and suppress your immunity (because we all know that excessive sugar intake does that).<br /><br />Don't be fulled into thinking your acquiring any real health benefit from drinking this.

I try to eat  healthy, but am by no means an authority so believe this product is good for you.  After all, Chantea won the Best New Product Award at the 2011 World Tea Expo.  I don't think it would have won for being bad tasting or unhealthy.<br /><br />I think drinking one a day could be a nice healthy snack.  More satisfying than just drinking water and much better than drinking soda pop.<br /><br />Aloe and green tea are so good for you, sugar in moderation isn't bad.

His grandmother would visit ""the old country"" every few years, leaving America with a suitcase full of Levi's and coming home with a suitcase full of meats and cheeses. One thing she always brought back was plain plastic bottles filled with this nutty green oil.<br /><br />After scouring every grocery store I went to for years on end, I finally caved and bought this very expensive bottle of oil. When he saw it his face lit up. When he sniffed it he drooled. Yesterday I made him a salad with it as a dressing, and he just about died.<br /><br />This is the real thing. If you want pumpkinseed oil, you will not be disappointed. There is nothing else like it.<br /><br />The shipping was pretty hefty, at $10 for the single bottle.

I did make a half-way decent bundt cake (though not very high) by adding an extra egg, milk instead of water, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and a package of lemon pudding.

139387,B000EM8308,5,Great Product from a great company The Ginger People,"I first discovered the Ginger people Christmas of 2005. A friend picked up a bottle of Ginger Peanut Sauce from T.J. Max, as they knew I liked ginger. I cooked with it, making things like Asian snap peas, which my friends started requesting at pot luck get togethers. (They thought I spent hours making them) Sadly my bottle was running out.  I looked on line to try to find more and ran across the Ginger People's website. I ordered a half a case of the Ginger Peanut sauce, and decided to try a couple of their other sauces. (All of which are excellent by the way)<br /><br />The website offered ""ginger chews"" which I'd bought before from Trader Joe's under Trader Joe's branding. So I ordered a couple of bags of those as I knew I liked them.<br /><br />By having my order reach a certain amount, the shipping was greatly reduced.<br /><br />Being short of the amount, I decided to try the Gin-Gins, even though I'm not a hard candy kind of guy.A few months later, I was glad I did, however, as one of my new medications gave me dry mouth during the afternoon and when I talked a lot.  I was able to put a Gin-Gin in my mouth which kept me from having dry mouth or having to chew on a Ginger Chew during meetings.<br /><br />I recently had another new med introduced, which has a side effect of nausea, the ginger chew helps calm that down, but isn't always convenient, like at meetings, socializing, or other types of interactions with others.  Gin-Gins to the rescue again.<br /><br />If you're prone to having an upset stomach, I can't think of too many , if any better way to settle that stomach down than a true ginger based product.  Gin-Gins are the perfect all around, right in any setting answer.<br /><br />When taking one out of my pocket, friends, co-workers, or clients, have asked to have one. I've yet to get anything put positive responses for Gin-Gins taste.

Do order this if you like green tea and want a refreshing tea drink.  With the addition of lemongrass, lemon balm, and verbena leaves, this is a fabulous step up from your run-of-the-mill green tea.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with lemongrass, lemon balm, or verbena, think of a light spritz of citrus.  Just something to lighten your green tea.  It's perfect for something warm before bedtime or (my favorite!) chilled to have as iced tea.<br /><br />To make the iced tea, use two teabags to 8 cups of boiling water.

He does not enjoy Science diet or Halo canned food much after he got a taste of Fancy Feast Grilled. It seems like he enjoys juicy textured food in his mouth. He is primarily on wet food because of his stomititis. I am on subscribe & save for the FFG, but have been looking for a good wet cat food to provide some variety. The real meat in a pouch idea appeals to me. Got the 10-pack box today at local Petsmart for $5.99. My cat usually favors the chicken flavor so I opened the chicken packet first. Lots of juice and soft meat and smells more like human food(to human nose). My cat finished it in record time. Success!! We are going to try out other flavors like Seafood next. It did draw my attention that this product was made in Thailand. I am not sure if that should be a concern (?). And if your cat is like mine, who sometimes cannot finish the 3oz portion in a meal, just store it upright in a ziplock bag and put it in the fridge for the next meal.<br />-----<br />Follow up: After two boxes, my cat is not so enthusiastic about it anymore. He would lick all the juice up and leave the content (especially the red color meat) in his dish...:-( He also doesn't like the chicken & duck flavor. If they sell only the chicken soup for cats, my cat would love it. The seafood (especially) tuna was a success for the first and second time and then he just doesn't like it any more.

I read that instead of using artificial flavoring they make the blend using actual vanilla beans.  Commercial coffee is usually flavored with artificial flavorings.  The ingredients in flavored coffees sometimes are associated with allergic reactions - especially when  propylene glycol is added.  Natural vanilla beans should not have an unhealthy reaction.<br /><br />I tried this coffee for several days.  When it was brewing I detected a slight vanilla aroma.

The former is fantastic and the latter is just okay.<br /><br />I actually found myself using a few more scoops of the bagged Natural Fusions coffee in an attempt to make it taste more like the original.  I guess if I didn't know how good the real thing was, I would have given this coffee at least 4 stars.  It's good, but not nearly as good as the real thing.

On the other hand, I gave it another shot with this product, and, while it definitely tastes better than other Starbucks home coffees I've had (hence the three stars), it still has a sense of bitterness.<br /><br />My co-worker, who is much better at brewing coffee than I am, made a pot at the office and told me to try some.  I did, hoping to get that amazing taste other reviewers have mentioned.  After making the cup of coffee that I always do, I sat down at my desk, had a sip, and waited for the full experience: the taste on the tongue, the swirl to the rest of my mouth, the final swig down my esophagus, and, finally, the awaited aftertaste.  It was fine until the last step: the aftertaste.  Here is where I recollected the pangs that bitter coffees leave, and it'll be a while till I try home-brew Starbucks again.  My co-worker even admitted it was bitter.<br />Now, don't get me wrong; I'm not completely anti-Starbucks.  While this specific home-brew leaves a wonderful vanilla initial taste, the in-store coffees taste better (but are still bitter to me), and their specialty drinks are amazing.<br /><br />Because I've had horrible experiences with Starbucks home-brew coffee, I wait for my trip to my grandparents' to drink home-made coffee, and will settle with my Nescafe.",Neutral

My expecations were raised further upon opening the bag with the deep aroma of both vanilla and coffee bean. However, once the coffee is actually brewed, the vanilla is nothing more than a strange aftertaste--and not even a vanilla taste. The coffee itself is strong, as one expect with Starbucks brand, but it's not as full-bodied as their House Blend or other blends, such as Verona. Something just seems to be missing. I'm not sure if they're using a lower quality bean or the ground vanilla beans and/or Indian sasparilla root (the other ingredient in the blend) is throwing the balance of the coffee off. Or, maybe it's my perception of vanilla coffee being sweet; this coffee most certainly is not.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",Negativo

If you're into granola bars, these will be a little bit of a departure as you really don't get that kind of consistency.  These are also nuttier, and overall seem to be more akin to a nut-based candy bar like a Payday.<br /><br />As far as the pluses go, the bars have a nice balance of sweet and salty, and though the consistency doesn't scream granola bar, it's just chewy enough that it also doesn't scream peanut bar (like the various brands of peanut brittle-esqe bars you tend to find in vending machines.)  The peanut butter coating on the bottom also has a nice consistency and taste, not chalky or too sweet like peanut butter tends to get in products like this.  Also, at 46 grams, it's pretty satisfying, and I'd think it would certainly make for a decent small meal on the go if you're in a pinch.<br /><br />There are some drawbacks though.  Mainly the bars can get a little messy where the peanut butter is concerned, so I can imagine it would be a nightmare with kids.  The bars are also pretty high in fat, which isn't as much surprising (they are peanut based), as it is unfortunate.  At 13g of fat per bar (3g saturated), these really are in the category of meal replacement, and not snacks.  If you're looking for a healthy snack I'd stick with a more basic granola bar.",Neutral

152366,B000LKZD4W,5,Very tasty and healthy jerky snack!,Hi! I could eat a box of this vegan jerky at one sitting. Delicious! The hickory smoke flavor is mildly hot without burning. There's to be a hint of maple syrup or similar tasting spice in the flavor. Texture seems right. Chewy but soft enough. The strips came in an outer paper box. Easy enough to open. The individual wrappings are easy to open with scissors. Tougher to open by hand. Individual wrapping has a cut at top for peeling open. I had no luck that way. For taking these on a hike it's a good idea to bring scissors. I recommend this jerky for a great snacking experience. I hope to buy other flavors in future orders.,Positivo

The price is great, they come in a six-pack that is not all that large and we find it convenient to be able to just quickly make a loaf of bread without having to pull out the recipe book and add lots of ingredients.  These make a 1 1/2 pound loaf if you're interested and it is pretty easy to make, just dump in the water, then the flour mix, some butter and the yeast...turn it on and wait! Overall, though, we found the taste to be pretty bland.  There is nothing special about the bread from this mix at all, but they have other flavors that are much tastier in my opinion for about the same price.  If you are looking for plain, white bread, then this will work out just fine.",Neutral

I have had a lot more success with their curry pastes. They do need a little more preparation than a simple cook-in sauce though and this is perhaps their strength & weakness. This particular dish requires you to marinade the diced meat (overnight in the fridge is best) in the sauce - half a jar for 4 chicken breasts. You then brown the meat in a wok with the marinade, add a tin of chopped tomatoes and finish with some plain yoghurt.<br /><br />As you can see, it's not something you can throw together at 5 minutes notice, but neither is it a complicated dish. However, the end result is a very convincing curry. My family are sissies when it comes to currys, but this is a perennial favourite. Not too hot for them and not too mild for me.",Positivo

If you put Keurig cup inside a regualar drip coffee maker, would you expect coffee to come out the other end?<br /><br />Now for those who have a Keurig machine and bought these, there is a solution.  If you have one of the cartridges that allow you to use loose coffee, for example <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI"">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>, then you can cut off one end of the pod and use the coffee.  This will give the product as intended.<br /><br />With that out of the way, let's turn to the product if you use it as intened or the ""Keurig workaround"" I illustrated above.<br /><br />Each pod comes individually foil wrapped for freshness.  When you open it, you are hit by the smell of strong coffee - perhaps even to the point of being pungent.  When brewed, however, it is strong but not overpowering and actually has a surprising sweetness to it one would not have expected from the aroma.  This is not a coffee that would appeal to those used to the mass produced variety or those who prefer a mild brew.  It is fairly strong and best savored rather than guzzled.

I like my coffee dark, so this was yet another hurdle I had to get past. Once I got to the taste, I was more than pleasantly surprised. The flavor was light, yet wonderfully smooth.

I like a company where you can still talk to a person, instead of a recording!)<br /><br />This food is so good, that I give my baby two each time she goes out and comes in as her treat and it is better for her than most treats out there on the shelves.<br /><br />I have shared a cup with two of my friends who have poodles (toys) and both are now using this and very happy with the product as well. This size is a significant savings too!<br /><br />Now that she is older and has some issues with her teeth, I can add a little water and let it sit about 10 minutes and it is still the taste she likes but softer and I know she is getting the nutrients she needs.<br /><br />So, if you poodle has his/her pom pom's in a wad over ucky tasting big dog food, you won't be disappointed with this!",Positivo

This meant two coffee packets in 6 ounces of water. While the coffee was brewing it emitted a very slight and barely detectable odor. When the brewing was finished it was time to drink coffee.<br /><br />This is by far the weakest coffee I have ever tasted.

The motto that this sauce adds flavor and not just heat is quite accurate.  I like spice in and on foods, but my measure for hot sauces is whether I can put some in a spoon and taste it without having to rush for a glass of cold milk.  Frank's passes this test; in fact, I've been known to take a nip when I'm just wanting a taste in my mouth!  It seems to be much better distributed in this part of the world than when it was done by Durkee's.  Hard to say whether it's my favorite, as they are all different.

161225,B008O3G2K2,5,An innovative invention much appreciated by canines,"with the exception of my senior chihuahua that viewed the container of Lickety Stik as possibly a lethal weapon and, not wishing to take any chances, tore out of the room when she saw it for under-the-bed protection.<br /><br />""Oh well,"" I said, ""I've got three other dogs.  Let's try them.""  At first my toy bichon-poodle was also wary and stepped back.  But when she saw my shepherd and chow chow growing very excited and thrilled by this new offering, she relented and tasted some herself.  It was a decided hit.<br /><br />There are no directions on the small plastic container as to how to use, so I was uncertain if I should squeeze it and, if so, how tightly.  I quickly learned that squeezing it too firmly causes the liquid to pour out so, if squeezed, ""lightly"" should be the watchword.  I would advise the first time trying it to place a paper towel under the container until one gets the hang of manipulating the small plastic bottle and administering the treat to the dog(s), which will not be a problem as my two large dogs, and eventually the smaller one, just kept wanting to lick and lick and keep on licking.  They found this new-found gadget to be very exciting.<br /><br />What is most appealing about it to me is that it contains all natural ingredients - nothing artificial.  They consist of natural flavors, cultured milk, lecithin, rosemary extract and green tea extract.  It also contains Vitamin A.<br /><br />So this is a fun way to make your dog(s) happy, small enough to carry in your pocket, light enough for easy carrying.

161270,B008O3G2K2,3,"Interesting product, but I'm not quite sure what to do with it","I am only reviewing the bacon flavor (was supposed to get 3 different flavors, but only got one).<br /><br />The good news is that my dog went crazy over this.  He absolutely loved it!  I have literally never seen him get this excited about a treat.  Unfortunately, that is also the bad news.  Because he loved it so much, and because he got so excited, it was a pointless exercise trying to get him to just lick the top.  He would take a lick or two, then he would start hopping and jumping, and trying to grab the entire bottle out of my hand.<br /><br />I have 11 and 10 year old daughters, and they normally love giving the dog a treat.  They won't give him this anymore, because it gets the dog hyper excited, and he starts jumping on them trying to get the treat out of their hands.<br /><br />So......whatever the ingredient inside the bottle is, my dog loves it, and I suppose yours will too.  The only question is the delivery system.  Maybe its not the best idea to have a treat that is meant to be held like this one is.  It assumes that your dog will sit quietly while you hold the bottle and he licks the top. No way that will ever happen with my dog.  He looks at it as he does any treat....he thinks it is meant to be taken and eaten.<br /><br />I debated on giving the product a 3 (because I don't think I will ever buy it for the reasons noted above) or a 4 (because my dog loves the flavor).  Ultimately I gave it a 4.  If my dog loves it, how could I give it a 3.<br /><br />**Update 10-5-11**Despite the fact that my dog loves the taste of this thing, I took it down to a 3 star rating.  Nothing really has changed, except for the fact that I am finding this to be more of a pain than I originally thought.  It was a novelty at first, but now I am weary of fighting the dog over this thing and trying to keep him from biting and chewing it (and creating a choking hazard or a mess).  Can't recommend it.<br /><br />**Update 10-9-11**I feel foolish writing another update on this product, but this is my last one.  My dog has gotten the hang of using this product, and now does a pretty good job of licking versusing chewing.  Also, this is one of his favorite treats. I am surprised, because my dog loves to chew, so I would have thought that a licking treat wouldn't hold much interest for him.  I am now thinking I would buy this product again ***but*** not at an $8 price point.  Way too expensive, relative to what you get.  The package says you get 500 licks.  In about 30 seconds, my dog get in 10-15 licks.  He does this twice a day, so this thing is not going to last 3 weeks at my house.  For me to buy this, it would have to be in the $2-3  price range.

162365,B000YSQ9GC,1,Poor Quality Product - Recall should be issued!,"After doing a lot of research on single grain oatmeal cereal, it's clear HappyBellies has the best ingredients (DHA from algea as opposed to fish oil and a better blend of probiotics as opposed to just one type). However, there definitely is some sort of production problem with the cans of oatmeal with a July 2012 expiration date.<br /><br />First, there is a distinct smell with this oatmeal. This oatmeal has a strong stale smell and looks grey in color. All other oatmeals have almost no smell at all and have a consistent light-khaki color.<br /><br />Second, the HappyBellies oatmeal does not thicken formula as other oatmeals do. Our son has acid reflux and we were told to add one tablespoon of oatmeal per ounce of formula. When I use Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, this makes the formula very thick - sludgelike. With the HappyBellies, no matter how much I add it doesn't thicken the formula at all. It remains watery and not suitable for a baby who spits up excessively.<br /><br />Third, I think our son has an allergic reaction to this oatmeal. He has no issue using the non-organic Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, but with the HappyBellies he has thrown up the formula/oatmeal immediately after eating it as if his stomach was upset. He also seemed to break out in a rash after putting him on HappyBellies after a couple of days.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviews that there definitely seems to be something wrong with this batch of oatmeal. I suspect that moisture somehow go into the oatmeal before it was sealed and as a result it rotted in the can, thus causing a bad smell, a grey color, and unable to absorb the moisture from the formula to thicken the solution. The grey color has even made me wonder if it's mold that has grown on the oatmeal.<br /><br />It's very clear to me that HappyBellies should issue a voluntary recall of this product!",Negativo

Could also tide you over between meals.  Still, I'd personally prefer something a bit healthier.  But that's why there's chocolate & vanilla--oops, they left out the vanilla!",Neutral

I found their flavor to be boring and bland compared to the best of other Cannellini beans I've purchased in bulk from health food stores.

They cooked quickly, which is a sign of freshness, and they tasted fresh.<br /><br />But their flavor was bland; some nice mineral notes, but just not very ""beany."" There were also some slightly off earthy notes, which I did not care for. I also found their texture to be a bit grainy and not very creamy.<br /><br />I cooked them once with an overnight cold soak in a salt brine (as recommended by Cook's Illustrated to tenderize skins, which really works) and once with a one-hour hot soak in brine (Cook's Illustrated's recommended quick method). One time I cooked them on a very slow simmer to keep the beans whole (which does sacrifice some creaminess), and once at a strong simmer to let the bean skins break open to maximize creaminess. But even this latter method failed to make them creamy -- unlike most white beans. I cook lots of dry beans and have many years of experience cooking beans, so how these beans turned out had nothing to do with how I cooked them. The best of other white beans I've had cook up wonderfully creamy and flavorful. These beans were just far from the best.",Negativo

Their entire line of sauces and salad dressings<br />are top notch, but this apple cider based marinade is pure magic.<br /><br />This stuff has transformative power. I've even used it on steak and the results were amazing,<br />but its best on chicken and pork (chops, ribs, and particularly tenderloin). Use it sparingly<br />and don't overmarinate, you'll be very happy with the results. A bottle of this stuff should<br />last you a long time, or maybe not cause its addictive.<br /><br />This is how Chiavetta's Catering makes chicken: You shake the bottle to mix its combination of<br />vinegar, salt, secret spices, and garlic then marinate uncooked chicken in it for at least 30<br />minutes before grilling the chicken over charcoal. During the grilling, you continue to baste<br />the chicken with the marinade, then remove the chicken, place it in a pan, baste it again, cover<br />it and let the sauce steam into the meat for 10 or 15 minutes.<br /><br />Simple enough, right?

I put them in the fridge as soon as I got them out of the mail since the packaging was hot but they didn't melt or change consistency.<br /><br />My boyfriend who loves anything cookie, actually didn't like these so much. He said they tasted like they weren't all the way cooked through, that might be the gooey middle giving him that impression.<br /><br />There are some white chips in the cookies, I am assuming they are white chocolate chips? They are kind of crunchy and I thought at first the cookie might have walnuts in it, but right now it is a mystery chip to me. The cookie is very sweet in my opinion. It lives up to it megafudge name with the sweetness and the gooey middle.<br /><br />I haven't made up my mind if I like this cookie or not. I kind of like the flavor but it is on the sweet side and I am iffy about the texture since it is not chewy as described in the title.",Neutral
177487,B004U49QU2,3,"Good, but not exactly great.","I'm not exactly a cookie connoisseur, but I love trying new types that are out on the market & I absolutely love soft cookies. I'd assumed from the ""chewy gooey"" part that the cookies would be soft, which was correct. I also assumed that anything with the word ""megafudge"" in it would also be pretty awesome. I was only partially right.<br /><br />Where the cookie goes right is that it's a very soft cookie. I don't think a hard cookie would really be all that great for something with fudge in the middle.<br /><br />Where the cookie goes wrong is that it's not particularly gooey as far as fudge goes. A thin layer of icing in a cookie does not automatically equate with gooey or fudge. The texture of this is also an issue. I shared some of these with a few of my coworkers & almost all of them mentioned that it was a strange texture, even the ones who adored the taste.<br /><br />Taste-wise this is ok. It's not a bad flavor, but it's not particularly great either. It's very rich & I wasn't really able to distinguish between any of the flavors (white chocolate, fudge, & chocolate). I hate to say it, but I've had better ""mega"" cookies.<br /><br />If you're looking for something ultra-decadent then you'll only partially find it here. I just don't think it's worth the guilt trip that I got later after eating them.

I don't know what the ""gooey"" stuff is in the middle, but it tastes incredibly artificial.  Plus, at 75 calories per cookie, they're hardly worth it.<br /><br />Considering all the chocolate they pile into these, they don't have that great of a chocolate flavor.  The concept is good, but the execution is a far cry from decent.  Also, the white chocolate chips in them - really?  What's the point of that?  If you're wanting megafudge cookies, are you really looking for white chocolate?  (Which actually has no cocoa in it...)  And I don't know if they had to alter the dough recipe in order to keep the fudge inside, but that part isn't good either.  It also has a kind of fake, I-left-these-in-my-hot-car-for-six-weeks kind of taste to it.  Blech!<br /><br />Personally, I'd rather have a regular chocolate chip cookie than these things.

My next puchase included the treat ball and a couple of other flavors (BBQ and Vanilla Mint). I put a Liver and a Vanilla Mint in the treat ball and she went LOVED the VM. It took effort this time to enjoy it, and she worked on it for over a week until there was nothing left but a disk of the treat in the treat ball (so I removed it, gave it to her, and put a new treat in the ball).

They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.

The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al.

I expected something too hard or overly grainy, but it actually is more reminiscent of a Biscoff cookie than anything else.

It was a home run.  Very peppermint, very creamy, perfectly sweet, very chocolatey, wouldn't change a thing.<br /><br />Next I tried Bellagio Peppermint Truffle hot cocoa (this one).

It isn't bitter, but it was necessary to add a little sweetener to bring out any flavor, else it was just a bland hot drink with a cooling minty affect.  Even then, the mint is more detectable by the cooling affect than by actual flavor.<br /><br />The third problem is that this hot cocoa isn't creamy.  I had to add a little half-and-half to make it creamy.  In contrast, Stephen's Gourmet Candy Cane hot cocoa only needed water to produce a very creamy hot cocoa -- probably because it includes Nonfat Dry Milk, while Bellagio Peppermint Truffle hot cocoa (this one) includes non-dairy creamer.<br /><br />The fourth and probably biggest issue is that this hot cocoa isn't very chocolatey, no where near as chocolatey as Stephen's Gourmet Candy Cane Hot Cocoa, and this is someone who actually prefers milk chocolate to dark/rich chocolate -- i.e., it is even weak by milk chocolate standards.<br /><br />Two stars for the following: 1) attractive and convenient packaging 2) it doesn't taste bad.<br /><br />Bellagio Peppermint Truffle Hot Cocoa is Made in the USA.  Directions: add 3 tablespoons of mix to 3/4 c. hot water and stir.  I also add a little sweetener and milk or cream.",Negativo

Mix the pumpkin variety with about one cup of COMPLETELY unsweetened whipped heavy cream without the vanilla.  And in both cases.....well, it's just very special! Indian in flavor, taste, color and aroma. And THAT certainly hits the spot, for us after a meal of roast lamb or tandori style chicken.

While it packs a lot of nutrition to start your day, two factors hold it back from being your new go-to item in the morning.  First, the taste is decent, but it works much more as an add-in like granola.  When mixed with yogurt or fruit, it does a great job of adding texture while not overpowering the other flavors.  Second, when you see for yourself how small each bag is, you realize how expensive of a product this is.  So even if you fell in love with the taste, most 99%ers would be hard-pressed to budget a bowl of it each morning.  If you're feeding a family of four, you'd be ordering more just about every other day.<br /><br />Our family was already familiar with the Kind bars and we really like them.

194589,B003ZT61E2,3,Needed to tweak recipe to taste good,"I've tried many flavors of Maxwell House's instant coffee drinks. They all do better with four ""well-rounded"" teaspoons instead of the flat four teaspoons the instructions suggest is all you should need for 6-8 oz water. i.e. Use 5-6 teaspoons per 6-8 oz water if you want a drink at all worth the time/money. It's a shame the packaging is not more honest with how much mix is really needed for a decent drink in order to fool customers into thinking they're getting more for their money than they really are. I tried one drink following the packaging directions just to make sure since it's a different flavor than what I've had before (6 oz water + 4 tsp mix). The result was a muddy looking pool of peppermint water.. no good mocha taste except what you might expect when you put some water in a dirty coffee cup and pick up the remnants of coffee - that's the only trace of ""taste"" other than peppermint I picked up.<br /><br />After adding an extra teaspoon (6 oz water + 5 tsp mix), I had a drink that was acceptable, but still not something I would favor enough to buy this mix over other flavors. The mocha taste is lighter than what you get from other flavored coffee mixes. I prefer stronger. At least I didn't find the mint or sweetness overpowering even with the extra teaspoon of mix.<br /><br />The best way I found to take this mix is adding in some extra instant coffee granules (6 oz water + 4 tsp this mix + 1 tsp other instant coffee mix + 1/4-1/2 tsp sugar). I added the sugar to counter the extra bitterness added by the regular coffee granules. This combination gave me a much more satisfying, flavorful drink, and I will continue drinking it this way until the powder is gone.<br /><br />I'm not happy with the fact I have to do so much tweaking on my end to get a good drink out of this. The whole point of these mixes is everything should already be in good proportion with proper instructions given on how much is needed to make it. If you don't mind the extra hassle, get this, otherwise, you might try other flavors that come with a better balance of tastes.",Neutral

I told my daughter my concerns, but she said she would try it and let her children try it as well!<br />  They found nothing wrong with it!<br />  It was very tasty as I said, but I can not of good conscience recommend this as a healthy snack!  It is extremely sweet and children should be where they can brush their teeth after eating it! Which they would not be able to do at school!  I would not want whatever that tiny hard thing I bit on[maybe a hard grain] to chip a child's tooth. The adult should try it first to see if they want their child have this either as a for snack for school or for outside playing!<br />  As I said it was very tasty, but it was hard and just to to sweet! I first gave it 5 stars, but I felt I was not being honest when I am trying to eat as healthy as I can! I will not buy this product for my grandchildren nor for me again! And I love nuts/grains/fruits and all the Antioxidants this product offers, but it is just too sweet and that out weighs any nutritional value you gain! If The maker would not have it so sweet as it is, then I would try it again and then could give it a better review!  Not everything that sounds healthy is healthy!

It's also much more sour than I expected.  The bottle should have a smaller opening as it drips down the side and pours out too quickly.  I'd recommend ripping out the plastic piece and dumping it in a cruet.<br /><br />It is smooth as some others have said and does not leave a bad aftertaste.  I think I'll save this for cooking and dressing rather than drizzling on food.  I imagine it would make a good reduction.  It does make a decent vinaigrette as I mixed it with olive oil and had a salad for breakfast this morning.  You don't need a lot.<br /><br />It's simply not up to par with better balsamics that work well with eveything. I'm partial to thicker, sweeter balsamics, so take that as you will.  If you like thinner, tangier balsamics then this may be for you.  I'd consider this more of a recipe ingredient than a condiment.<br /><br />The Amazon price is also on the high side.

But after researching Hill's on the internet, I found almost no difference between Hills prescription diet and other cheap cat foods, so the search began...<br /><br />About 7 hours later from searching all sorts of brands and reviews and information on the internet, I still had exactly no idea what to get, so I wandered into the local grocery store. After looking at all of the ingredients on the bags and cans, (and finding out from a woman nearby that man dogs and cats get very sick from red food dye in the different foods- good thing to know), I settled on Newman's Organics even though it ranked among the most expensive per can. Why? Whole foods, no fillers, organic product...<br /><br />Got the food home, had prayed about this, literally, because I was very worried about my cat. As soon as I opened the can, and put it in the dish, she tested it out by licking it at first, and then, much to my delight, ate for the first time in days. Amen. I was so glad. Now lol we open up a can, and wow, lol she seems to say, hurry up already, put it in my dish! LoL.. we combine the Newman's own with Purina One dry food alternating the wet and dry every other feeding, but she has felt better. She has boundless energy. Her coat in just a week, has gotten very soft and sleek, not greasy, but wonderfully nourished. She is acting like a kitten again.

Thirdly, I had plenty of holes in my socks and underpants.<br /><br />I eventually made it to a small town in China where I visited the local Apothecary.

The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ"">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0"">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that's a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.

205414,B000Z3IQ3U,1,2 bags rancid! calling company today!,"UPDATED APRIL 2012: I'm returning 6 more pouches of PureBites Chicken today, after first calling the company for instructions. The same rep (female) who responded to my complaint in  Dec 2011 took my call today, but not knowing I had called before, she kept insisting there has never been a complaint about rancid bits before. I told her I called in Dec and she said ""someone else likely helped you"". Not wanting to argue, I moved on, but she clearly lied to me so I thought I should update about this. I was asked to include a note this time, to say where purchased but that has nothing to do with the fact that the company thinks it's ""acceptable"" that some fat is getting thru via processing. Fat cannot be freeze-dried so it will turn rancid even if freeze dried - read my original review and see how this was answered the 1st time I called last year...Very disappointing that the company doesn't care to hold the processing plant's feet to the fire about fat getting in, but then to lie to a customer is not good. But they will honor their satisfaction guarantee! So the only way to get this issue resolved is for all of us to get refunds. All you need to do is send the proof of purchase and your invoice to the address on the bag, along with your name & address. I find that about half of the bags are rancid. Dogs don't care, but cats won't eat rancid anything so very expensive if issue is ignored. Pls help make this company fix this issue by sending proofs in and forcing them to refund. Companies ignore issues until their wallets get hit. I hate to do this, but my cats beg for these and I'm going broke replacing rancid bags!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought two 6.2 oz bags of PureBites Chicken for dogs, first trying out a small cat size pouch found at PetSmart, and then moved up to the dog-sized bags/chunks, which I crumble with my fingers to get them smaller for my cats, who love this product BUT both of these bags purchased on Amazon had rancid chunks that smushed into slimy/greasy mush when I crumbled them.<br /><br />The company admits this happens, said it's part of the processing, nothing can be done, but it's not acceptable, and they will refund once I send proof of purchases & invoice to them.<br /><br />So it's hit or miss, and the company agrees...so just an FYI to warn others to check their bags!<br /><br />For those feeding this to dogs, and not breaking up the chunks like I do, please take note of this and check on the chunks before feeding. You can also detect a faint rancid odor if there are rancid bits in your bags.<br /><br />The reason for the rancid chunks, according to the company is that pieces of fatty chicken do get in, and fat doesn't freeze-dry, so without preservatives, it will go rancid. I knew that, but had hoped they could offer a promise to correct this; they can't and have no intention to do so. So I'll keep buying and hoping I get good bags, but will certainly take the time to get refunded whenever this occurs.<br /><br />The product is excellent when you get a good bag..just check each piece before feeding, or if you have a good nose for rancid odors, take a whiff and you'll smell the slight rancid odor, and can return the product.",Negativo

A generous teaspoon of Lapsang Souchong steeped for about three and a half minutes in roughly 190-200 degree water will yield a strong, flavorful cup of the Fujian Province's most notable tea. What is so respectable about Culinary Teas' Lapsang is that it manages to contain immense flavor with very little of the aftertaste common to lower-grade Lapsang Souchong.<br /><br />But how does it TASTE? The answer is both mysteriously complex and blindingly simple. A quick sniff of the pine-needle-roasted leaves brings forth the aroma of a campfire; this flavor carries well into the brewed tea, creating a strong, smokey aroma and flavor that does not fade as the tea cools. Culinary Teas' evenly fired, full-leaf Lapsang Souchong ought to be placed at the top of any tea enthusiast's shelf as the strongest, most impression-making tea in Culinary's collection. One does not forget the first experience with Lapsang. Do it right by using this brand.",Positivo

""If I hadn't hired Eddie Valiant to get the job done, the cops would still have their heads down a rabbit hole!"" and ""Where the %@*& is my uncle's head?""<br /><br />Born Oscar Q Rabbit to a theatrical family of animated characters specializing in animal roles, Rabbit was hired by the Disney Studios when just a tiny bunny. Nicknamed ""Thumper"" for an endearing but nervous twitch of the left hind foot, he eventually became known throughout the world by that single name, joining the exclusive rank of one named stars such as Cher, Madonna and Pele.<br /><br />Cast as a child character in a small supporting role in the movie Bambi in 1942, Thumper's adorable and enduring persona lit the screen with a charisma way beyond that of a humble sidekick.<br /><br />A memorable line in Bambi became the touchstone of Thumper's life. ""If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all!"" formed the basis of what is now known as ""The Thumperian Principle"" . Grown to a world movement, Thumperian disciples believe in the tenant that bad grammar and good deeds are cosmically linked.<br /><br />Thumper continued work at the Disney Studios with Thumper2 and Thumper Goes Exploring but was eventually released from his contract when as a young adult, despite desperate efforts, he could not control the twitch in his hind leg. Rumors of drug abuse were never proven although Thumper spent several months at a private hospital for reported exhaustion  after completing the filming Thumper Goes Exploring.<br /><br />Never making the transition to television as did his younger relatives, Crusader Rabbit and Bugs Bunny, Thumper's career floundered until he was reduced to starring in three rabbitsploitation movies, ""Suck My Carrot"", ""Young Bunny Coed Love"", and finally, ""The Bunny Hole"".<br /><br />A long time alcoholic and well known visitor to the watering holes along the Sunset Strip and Las Vegas, Thumper lent his name to what has become a popular drinking game.<br /><br />Thumper spent his final years prior to his disappearance making celebrity appearances at Bambi reunions and Thumperian conferences and spent two seasons on Hollywood Squares where the muffled thumping of his hind led could often be heard in the background.<br /><br />Thumper was the founder and president of the ""Shake A Leg Foundation"" a research and charitable organization for rabbits and other small mammals suffering from hind leg movement disorder. Contributions to the foundation can be made in his name.<br /><br />Thumper is survived by his older brother, Benjamin Bunny, his nephew, Roger Rabbit, and his fourth wife, Jessica Rabbit and 974 children.",Neutral

208381,B005CUU23S,2,"Good for a go around, but probably not the staple snack for Charlie","The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're ""healthier;"" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that.

Instead read some of these reviews for very good tips.<br />I got two moles in about five days. It took me a little bit to learn where and how to set it. I pretty much followed the good advise given in other post, I recommend you do the same, their method works.<br />Before this trap I tried a bunch of less-aggressive methods but to no avail. It is really hard to get rid of moles in a nice way. Finally I got fed up and went for a trap. Also, with a trap you can see the body of the critter and know for sure that you got it.<br />The trap has a simple-but-effective design, it is built of solid, black-painted iron and it is bigger and tougher than what I thought it was going to be from the product pictures, but it is not huge. The spring is very strong and I have to put my weight on it (using the provided levers) to set it (remember to use the locking hook).<br />The triggering mechanism is simple and reliable, although I used a file to round the edge of the holding ""stick"" to make it slide out easier of the trigger piece (added sensitivity) but be careful not to over-do it! or it will trigger by itself.<br />The trap stays out-of-sight in my backyard because it lays low and it is black. I added a bunch of tree leaves on top of it to make it invisible. The leaves don't interfere with its functioning.<br />The most difficult thing about setting this trap is placement. I'm still learning where is the most likely tunnel that the mole is going to use. I'm using little construction flags to mark tunnels that I step on to find out which tunnels are the most active.<br />One if the moles that it caught was still alive when I checked the trap, so bring a shovel with you in case you need it.<br />Also the price is very good compared to other very expensive traps.<br />I highly recommend this trap.",Positivo

After doing a little research at home, Seattle Public Utilities website ([...]) states that they approve BioBag and therefore can be thrown into the Food & Yard Waste bin.  However, King County's website ([...]) states that pet waste can NOT be thrown into the Food & Yard Waste bin.  Feeling a little confused, I decided to call Seattle Public Utilities to find out exactly which bin the pet waste BioBag can be tossed in.  Boy, I am glad I called the city before purchasing these bags!  The employee stated that while these bags are compostable, pet AND human wastes contain harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites that may continue to live on.  Because of health hazard reasons, the best way to dispose of these is to toss them into the garbage bin regardless of whether the bag is compostable or not.  After saying all this, the employee basically said that I should save money and buy regular pet waste bags and use the BioBags for food compost instead.<br /><br />Here are links I found afterwards that support what the employee told me (minus the health hazard details):<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]",Neutral

212970,B0029NICD8,1,Counterfeit cat food??,"Note: This review is specifically for this Cat food, sold by Amazon.com in a Pack of 48 pouches. Purchased in February of 2012.<br /><br />We have an extremely picky cat with health issues who will eat nothing but Whiskas Seafood pouches (not even the other Whiskas pouches). We've purchased this food from a number of different sources but noticed that it cost 50-70% less on Amazon, so we ordered a large quantity. Right as we started feeding our cat the food purchased on Amazon, he suddenly started leaving large amounts of food (which we had to throw away) and losing weight rapidly. We did not initially associate this with the food, and assumed it was a health issue, but could find no evidence of any problem. It was as if the cat suddenly had gone off his food.<br /><br />Fast forward three weeks or so: We've been feeding our cat Amazon's Whiskas, throwing away half of what he leaves in the bowl, and are still having no luck trying different types of food. Suddenly it occurs to me that his new 'health problem' started when we began giving him the Whiskas pouches from Amazon. So I examine the pouches, and here is what I find:<br /><br />- The packaging is in every way identical.<br /><br />- The consistency is much thinner. Where the gravy is thick and clings to the package in Whiskas pouches from Safeway/Petsmart/Petco, the gravy is watery in the Amazon version. This is best described as: The Amazon stuff immediately pours from the package, whereas the stuff from other stores has to be squeezed out and sticks to the side of the pouch.<br /><br />- The expiration dates on Amazon's pouches differs from the date on Amazon's boxes. The expiration dates on Safeway/Petsmart/Petco boxes is consistent: the same on the pouch as on its box.<br /><br />- Both Amazon and other food had an expiration date that was Jan/Feb/March of 2013, so nothing was expired and they were supposedly all manufactured around the same time.<br /><br />- Amazon's cat food is mysteriously WAY cheaper than even Petsmart. 50% cheaper. That is a suspiciously huge price difference for a 'grocery store item', even for Amazon's great prices.<br /><br />So I go to the store, get some more of Safeway's Whiskas Seafood pouches. As soon as I put it in the cat's bowl, he hungrily starts biting into it, as if he hasn't eaten in weeks. (and he barely has!) We finish the box of Safeway Whiskas pouches, and before contacting Amazon, I decide to switch back to the remaining Amazon pouches to see what happens: The cat doesn't eat it. Will not touch it. He won't even lick the gravy off of it, which is normally the first thing he does. I gave him the food this morning, and he hasn't eaten a bite. I let the other cats into his feeding room (they're on dry food but will eat his wet food when they get a chance), and not one of them touches the food.<br /><br />After the food has sat there completely untouched for about 10 hours, I go to amazon.com to initiate a return. Turns out you're not allowed to return this kind of consumable! However, knowing Amazon's history of being an exceptionally fair and honest company, I contacted customer service, and explained the problem to them. They immediately processed a refund, with full apologies, no need to return the item. (I'm throwing it away)<br /><br />So thank you Amazon for your outstanding customer service. I greatly appreciate it and will remain a frequent Amazon customer as I have been for 15 years. I've asked your customer service rep to open an investigation to find out if this cat food is counterfeit. I will apparently receive a report about the investigation.<br /><br />In the meantime I recommend to customers that you do not order the Whiskas Pouches through this page (maybe a different provider through Amazon would be fine). You may risk feeding your animals counterfeit (possibly harmful) food.",Negativo

214375,B001E5E1XW,4,"Mostly impressive, a touch disappointing.","First, allow me to say in summary: This is good Masala Chai.  It's a mostly balanced blend with a good mix of quality ingredients that tastes great when brewed properly; however, in its only shortcoming, the flavor of actual tea is somewhat weak, likely due to the condition of the leaves in the blend, which may or may not be Rishi's fault.  It's always possible the package was treated harshly in transit resulting in a can full of small leaf pieces as opposed to full leaves.  I won't be able to say until I'm done with this one and get more, which I probably will do.  Now only the longer version:<br /><br />I've long been a fan of Masala Chai, brewing it in pots in the traditional manner at home before it became popular in cafes and giving long-winded explanations to people why the term ""chai tea latte"" should never be used thereafter.  I prefer chai that tastes nothing like the mild, over-sweetened brews sold at most cafes in this country.  Instead, ones like those found at authentic Indian restaurants have been my preference, but even then I've found many do not do as good a job with their Masala Chai as I would have liked.  It is very safe to say I can be picky about my Chai.  Snobbish, even.  My supplier of choice for years had been a local tea artisan who mixed his own teas and made fantastic blends I've yet to find the match of.  Sadly, he closed some months ago leaving the world bereft of his magnificent concoctions.  This left me hunting for a new supply everywhere I could look from local tea shops, to high-end grocery stores, to the internet.  This also meant I have tried a number of Chais I did not care for.  Rishi's is not one of those.  It is, in fact, one of the better one's I've tried.<br /><br />It's made with a solid blend of ingredients.  This tea suffers no ""innovations"" in the name of trying to distinguish itself.  It's ingredients are whole and it's flavors generally balanced.  It's also fairly strong.  This one surprised me given the condition it seemed to be in when I opened it.  I was prepared for the worst, as most of the tea leaves seemed broken into small pieces, but came out pleasantly surprised.  In all, for someone looking for a good chai, this is an easy recommendation to make.  Considering it won the World Tea Championship's award last year for best chai, this isn't particularly surprising, though.  Also, it is certified both fair trade and organic, for whatever that is worth to you.<br /><br />What is surprising is it's one weakness.  As I've said, when I opened my first canister to brew a cup, I found no whole tea leaves.  Instead I found many small pieces of tea leaves.  From a company of Rishi's reputation this was shocking.  The predictable result was the flavor of tea was weak and unbalanced compared to those of the spices, which were strong and balanced with each other well.  This was a disappointment, and I expected not to care for the tea at all while it was brewing, but this proved not to be the case.  Still, this may have been my favorite blend were it not for that.  (As it stands the pricier Ineeka holds that spot) It's wholly possible the condition of the leaves was caused during delivery.  I won't know until my next order.<br /><br />Yes, ""My next order.""  In spite of it's one real flaw, I will be placing another order.  As I said, this is good tea, and really, for the price, I have not found another tea whose quality competes.  Still, I will probably take the advice of some of the other reviewers and start supplementing it with some black tea leaves of my own.",Positivo

It has 3 ingredients--barley, malted barley, and chicory.  Maybe I am hooked on the chicory.  Is that possible?  I doubt it.  Anyway, I swear this stuff tastes more like coffee every time I drink it.  I have been tempted to play a practical joke with people at work by asking them to try my new ""coffee"".

Of all my years on Amazon.com, this by far has been the worse.  On December 24th, 2008 I ordered a Vend Star Vending Machine.  The listed shipping price was $14.99 and the total amounted to $59.99.  I made my purchase and eagerly waited for my vending machine to arrive. Around three weeks elapsed before I heard from the company.  When I was contacted by the company, they told me that the machine would not be shipped unless additional money was sent to cover the shipping.  Although I had already made my monetary purchase for the listed price (including shipping), my order was being held and I was told that I had to pay more to cover the additional costs for Pegasus Enterprises because they listed the wrong shipping price.  Needless to say, I was not willing to pay additional to cover Pegasus's Mistake.  They cancelled my order and I will not receive my machine.

It may or may not be better or worse for health than the tap water, since they only list the ""good"" minerals that are in it...maybe they shouldn't list fluoride. My tap water is deliberately treated to be free of the most dangerous contaminants.<br /><br />Fiji implies (though they don't concretely claim) that this water comes from a CONFINED aquifer and that means it is not replenished by rainfall so there is none of the airborne pollution we have seen in the atmosphere over the last 150 years or so. Of course this means that it will run out, so I guess buy it while you still can!

""Peach Tea"" is the only flavor I have tried so far and I found it rather gross.  My opinion is rather subjective, but I thought it only had a vague hint of ""peach"" that was blocked out by a lot of tartness.  It also left a bad aftertaste in my mouth.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this product, but the taste just wasn't for me.  I'm going to give at least one other flavor a try to see if it's more palatable.  This product would be very convenient if I liked the flavor better since I could just put it in a cabinet at my office and add it to the water I'm drinking continuously throughout the day.

222432,B004E4CCSQ,4,One way to wean yourself off soda,"If you're trying to wean yourself off of sugary drinks, this could be a good option. The fact that it's a squirt bottle means you can use as much or as little flavoring as you like, and gradually step down the amount you're adding. It's also a small package you can carry around rather than ending up buying soda or over-sweetened water drinks.<br /><br />On the minus side, I don't really detect any 'tea' flavor, just peach. On the plus side, I didn't detect any unpleasant aftertaste, but perhaps that's because I wasn't using a large amount--just a single squirt in a glass of water.<br /><br />One thing I do wish they'd do is skip the acesulfame-K and just use sucralose for the sweetener; sucralose is generally considered safe, whereas acesulfame-K is not. Probably won't be drinking it on a regular basis for that reason.",Positivo

After adjusting the amount used, I got it to where I really like it. Less is definitely better. The flavor isn't all that natural tasting, but it is very pleasant when you don't use too much. I highly recommend you start out with only a drop or two, until you reach your desired level of flavor. I like MIO Peach Tea, but I only recommend it if you're a fan of fruity diet drinks.

Now I aadmit to not reading the directions the first cup and at first was like wow slightly chocolate water and added a few more spoonfuls of the mix to my cup and it improved but was not quite what i expected and this was made with water(I was at work and had little choice) The next day I deceided to try it again at home in my hot cocoa machine with milk and there was a GREAT improvement!! So as a result I'm going to try an experiment tonight and make a shake in the blender with the mix!!! I said im a peanut butter cup freak!!!",Neutral

After receiving this in the mail, I tried a bowl of it the very next morning.  As I took my first bite, the chocolatey taste filled my mouth, and at first I was in heaven.  The one thing that I did NOT like about this cereal was the actual cereal surrounding the chocolate.  I was hoping for something with a little more crunch to it, like Cap'n Crunch.  What I got was a very soft coating that had very little, if any, crunch to it.  Because it was such a soft cereal coating, it got soggy very quickly.  If Kellogg's could make the outer portion crunchier, then I would gladly buy this cereal.  As it is, I will leave it on the shelf.",Neutral

And we ate the whole box ourselves.  I know some of the reviews have been really negative, but all three of us enjoyed this cereal.  To be honest, I hardly got any of it myself, because my daughters gobbled it up.  We enjoyed it dry, without milk, but we also enjoyed it in the traditional way, with milk. Some of the reviewers said it turned to mush in milk ... but we didn't have that experience.  Maybe they started with too large a bowl, or ate too slowly, but it did not turn to mush for us.  It did soften a bit, but my daughter decided she actually liked it better that way.  We'll be watching for coupons so we can buy more Krave ... to hide from the younger children again.",Positivo
223772,B00429PXHK,2,"Well, at least they have vitamin D.","As you can tell just by the picture of the cereal, this stuff contains enough sugar to wipe out an entire village of diabetics. So unless you want to be another victim of Mary Poppins' misinforming ways, steer clear of this. That being said, I expected a lot more out of this cereal aside from the usual great cereal marshmallows. That's all this stuff has going for it! It's too bad, since Fruity Pebbles is easily one of my top 10 cereals, and I was hoping this would be at least somewhere in the same ballpark as those. Nope, not even close.<br /><br />The marshmallows are what you'd expect- the same kind like in Lucky Charms. But the pebbles portion of the cereal looks like hamster pellet food. Seriously, pouring it into my bowl, I frowned and wondered what I was getting myself into. But after I poured the milk, I was debating on if I should dump it down the drain. Not one to waste food, I took on the bowl, and was disgusted by the texture of the pebbles in my mouth. These things get soggy FAST. Unless the free prize inside each box was a twenty dollar bill, I'm not going back for more.<br /><br />If you need marshmallows in your cereal, stick with good ol' Lucky Charms or one of the knock-offs.

224265,B000QSN7P6,1,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",Negativo

First let me say I'm very pleased, the flavors are not bad at all and i can use my own filtered water from either the fridge or Pure faucet attachment and no longer need to pay or bring back bottles for the deposit.

As for the cost it has changed everything, no longer have to pay deposit, return empties or search for sale price on soda which means lot less trips to the store saving me from impulse buying and gasoline usage. I can now make fresh bottles of soda whenever I need it (unlike store bought soda which can lose carbonation)  and any flavor I feel like at the time.

Definitely not too strong, and the hazelnut flavot itself leans a *bit* toward the weak side. if you want more hazelnut flavor, I would say add hazelnut creamer.<br /><br />Again, overall, its just ok.

It's tasteless no matter how long you brew it. There's no aroma to it and it tastes like water. I've checked the expiration and it's got a good 2 years to go so it's not due to prolonged storage.

Vibrant, healthy looking colors made me feel like they were getting some healthy vegetables in the mix too.<br />This definitely warrants a suggestion from me to consider buying this product for your dogs.

240144,B001VJ0B0I,3,Not something i'd use again,"This Beneful is a rather confusing or misleading product. The company wants you to think this food is healthy for your pet. The reality is though that it is nothing other than a bag of grain and fillers. Sure, many dogs may like it and eat it, but it is not exactly nutritious for them.<br /><br />My dog didn't seem to mind it too much. He didn't seem overly excited by it, but he did eat it. He poked around at it a bit though beforehand.<br /><br />He did have much softer, lighter colored stools too, and went to the bathroom more often. The stools did not look like ""healthy"" stools. It was more like a step or two away from diarhea. I hate to sound gross here, but it is important to mention.<br /><br />The bag does clearly depict corn and veggies right on the picture on the front, so I guess it should be no real surprise, but it just seems like Purina was almost trying to pull as fast one on the consumer - make the food sound/look healthy and beneficial even though it is no better than the cheapest generic bag you could possibly find. Also, notice how the picture of the ear of corn is so prominent in comparison to the other items - it is because this dog food is mainly corn, as is with most all cheap/generic brands.<br /><br />For some, this may be suitable, but it is not something that I want my dog to eat regularly. I mean, if I was really super tight on cash, and my dog was out of food and Beneful was dirt cheap, clearanced, on sale etc - sure I might grab it to use for a day or two until I could buy him a bag of real food... but as for buying it regularly for daily consumption, it would never happen. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else either unless your vet specifically tells you that your dog needs a corn and grain filled diet because of some serious health issue or something.

I know the main ingredient is corn, but I have to believe that the formulation isn't going to kill him.

The third is the pseudo-gourmet market again dominated by the major brands with weird names to try to make folks think they are part of group 4 which is gourmet/specialty dog food, those that specialize in high protein, low grain and filler foods.<br /><br />Beneful is IMHO as good as it gets in general market dog food. My dog likes it, though he will sometimes let it sit for extended periods if he can find anything else.

When placed side by side with his current food he immediately went to and wolfed this down.

Following instructions the first time (4 teaspoonfuls of coffee) the coffee had a nice frothy appearance and definitely satisfied the sweet tooth.  In fact, the next time I added only three teaspoonfuls and the flavor was still adequate. The manufacturer mentioned making it with milk and I suspect this would give it a richer taste, but to me the addition is unnecessary.  For the frugal amongst us, I occasionally use this mix as a sweetener for my regular coffee and even this makes an unusual autumn blend.<br /><br />I am having a cup of the product and it definitely takes some of the chill out of a frosty morning.

I actually think the sauce is quite flavorful and would be good on a taco (particularly with white meat like fish or chicken).

I've liked some other k-cups in the past, but they haven't been available on Keurig's site for a while.<br /><br />Anyway, I finally gave in and bought the Starbucks Breakfast (and House) Blend k-cups (from Keurig's site). Neither is like getting the same cup at Starbucks. I realize it can't be exactly the same, k-cup vs large brew. The Breakfast Blend k-cup is ok, I guess.  But it just doesn't have any of the complexity you taste in a cup from Starbucks. It's just ""a cup of coffee"".  I brew it on the 2nd (~7 oz) cup size on my brewer... smaller is too strong/bitter and larger is too watery.

After decades of being loyal to Pepsi (until three years ago when I gave up everything with HFCS in it for health and weight management reasons) I thought I could enjoy Pepsi again.

Both the diet ginger ale and diet tonic have a nasty aftertaste - way worse than any name brand diet soda on the market.  The worst part about the aftertaste is that it doesn't seem to go away. As I write this, I still have a bad taste in my mouth - and it's been nearly a half hour since I drank some of the diet ginger ale. That alone compelled me to pull out my computer and log a review. I have tried them several times now, altering the amount of syrup to see if it would make a difference, and each time I end up pouring it down the drain. I am SO disappointed by this as I had high hopes for flavorings.",Negativo

I asked if I could still order some from her int he original formulation, or where I could buy them like that, but she said no.  The only reasons she gave were some type of problem with the formulation and baking f the cookie, but I don't understand beacause they were perfect??!  A better explanation would have been nice.

This is a common problem when people try to make a gluten free cookie that have no experience in baking with gluten free flours.  Lucy's cookies remind me of Pamela's cookies which are also dry.  Being dry is not a sin that a little milk or coffee can not take care of.  However what I cannot stand is an after taste.  The base flour combination has an odd after taste that spoiled the little enjoyment I had from this cookie.  I looked at the ingredients and found garbonzo and fava bean flours.  I cannot recommend this cookie based upon the after taste.  I have not tried the other varieties that may have stronger flavors to cover up the after taste.

You can use it with Chinese or Korean dishes. It works great in your favorite rice casseroles. I like to cook it in our ricemaker, then flavor it by adding a few fresh or frozen peas, a shake of our favorite herbs (dried basil, dried New Mexico oregano), and a swirl of olive oil mixed with Hungarian paprika.

I've been enjoying a lot of things from them recently, including Kamut Breakfast Cereal and a really delicious soup mix. Their Buckwheat Pancake mix is another example of a healthy, tasty, and reasonably priced item from Bob's Red Mill. I got a taste for Buckwheat pancakes as a kid (My mom used to make them on cold mornings in January), but stopped eating them as an adult. My wife LOVES pancakes, and while I enjoy them too, I find the regular kind not keep me filled up, nor are they particularly healthy. I remembered that I used to really like buckwheat pancakes, and decided to hunt some up. I found these, and have been enjoying them ever since.<br /><br />The mix is easy to prepare, but this isn't a 'complete' mix and does require an egg and some oil in addition to cold water. As an alternative you can use milk, which gives the pancakes a slightly richer flavor. Milk or water, either way they're tasty! Buckwheat is a wholegrain, meaning these fill you up and keep you filled much longer than traditional pancakes which are full of sugar and cheap carbs. I can eat probably a dozen regular pancakes. I can only manage to put away 5-6 of these guys!<br /><br />A few recommendations on preparation:<br /><br />1) Mix the pancake batter and then let it sit 30 minutes or even an hour in your refrigerator. It makes the pancakes lighter and fluffier.<br /><br />2) Go for thinner batter rather than thick. It makes the pancakes easier to cook, and gives you a tastier pancake as a result.<br /><br />3) Cook on medium heat, not high. Because the batter is dark to begin with, it is harder to tell when your pancakes are done without overcooking them. Use less heat to help you get them cooked perfectly.<br /><br />4) You can easily mix this batter with a regular pancake mix to make 'hybrid' cakes if you find these are a bit too thick for your taste. I've gone that route a few times for my wife since she likes her pancakes less dense than these.<br /><br />5) Get yourself some real maple syrup! Nothing goes as well with Buckwheat pancakes than real maple syrup! That's how the American pioneers ate them, and I love feeling like I'm participating in an American tradition when I make these for my family.<br /><br />6) Eat them for dinner!

It seems every normal-sized spoonful has 5-6 raisins on average. It's enough to make me look up the health benefits of raisins, as I can't see a cereal this sweet as being very healthy. As suspected, raisins are full of calories, mainly from sugars. If you're looking for a very healthy cereal, look elsewhere. This one seems to be made for those with a sweet tooth, though I guess some may find that sweetness from raisins is better than sweetness from other ingredients (ex. high fructose corn syrup).<br /><br />My rating reflects my personal opinion and taste, more than the quality of the product. Amazon shipped them to me in a shape no worse than found at a local grocery store and the flakes are still very crisp and palette pleasing, with the sell by date 6 months away (Mar '13). It seems fresh enough. It's the ratio of raisins and flakes that bugs me; I guess I was hoping more for a bowl of Wheaties with only a handful of raisins, for 1-2 raisins per spoonful on average.<br /><br />As a warning for those who don't normally eat raisin bran, beware that this cereal is dense. 20 oz of this stuff comes in a similar sized box as some others' 10-14 oz boxes. If you eat a bowl of it, filled up the same amount as you would with something like Cheerios, this will leave you a heavy feeling in your stomach. I recommend mixing some of this cereal with some other cereal, to make it more palatable, with my favorite being Quaker Oatmeal Squares, though I imagine this goes well with many other cereals.<br /><br />Also note that these boxes currently do not have any Kellogg's Family Rewards codes, at least the three I checked do not.

268394,B000RPHEIE,3,Seaaloe,"I have only been taking this supplement for a few days, so I'm not sure how helpful this review will be, maybe I will update it after taking it for awhile. First, the taste is really good, for a supplement. It taste like slightly sweetened cherry extract, with a flat (nothing there) aftertaste. I was suprised for a liquid supplement it has no bitter or mineral taste. I could take it every day easily. And I do like that it is a whole food and not a man made supplement.<br />  What I don't like about it is that it doesn't list how much of something you are getting or the daily percentage of RDA. I don't think it has been evaluated by consumer labs - I didn't see it listed, but then again I didn't sign up. I don't like how it is marketed, you can sell it yourself, and I tend to distrust home marketing businesses. I'm not sure I like that it has D'Arco in it, the lady at the health food store said that it has no known side effects or contraidictions, but I have seen online reports of possible effects.<br />  As for effectiveness, I have only been taking it for a very short time, so the review is not complete. But, I have noticed my skin is firmer, and I have a healthy pink glow to my face. This usually happens if I am taking a good antioxidant. I haven't noticed any increase in energy. There does seem to be a slight decrease in joint pain (D'Arco is supposed to be good for inflammation). My gums look healthier, but I have also been using Biotene mouthwash. So I guess what I am saying, is take at your own risk, or do more research. Maybe there are better liquid supplements out there, with no herbs in them. Even herbs that have no reported side effects, sometimes have bad effects for me.",Neutral

268565,B004SRFYMK,1,You couldn't pay me to drink this!,"I recently started researching the benefits of drinking coconut water and consuming coconut oil daily because I have been trying to change my lifestyle from one of total nutricious abandon to healthy yet happy.  I absolutely love cooking with coconut oil, adding it to my morning coffee, using it as a skin moisturizer, anything and everything I possibly can use it for, and have been telling all of my friends and family.  I never really liked coconut so it did take a little bit to get used to the coconut taste with the oil.  The coconut water, however, was a little trickier.  I knew it would be very beneficial to hydrate myself with it after a hard workout so this is what I decided to do: I bought the Zico 14-ounce bottle of natural coconut water from my local supermarket and also bought a can of Goya's coconut water with pulp to see which one I would be able to drink.  I tried the Zico first thinking that since it's in a plastic bottle and so much more expensive it would be the natural winner.  I had chilled the coconut water in the fridge all day and when I opened the bottle and poured it into a glass I noticed a funny odor immediately.  After my first taste I was horrified at how terrible it was.  It's hard to describe, kind of plastic(y), bitter, and just nasty!  I've had coconut water/milk straight from a coconut before and it was delightful, Zico's does not taste a THING like that.  I know that this has no added sugar whereas Goya adds a little and Zico is ""supposedly"" pure but from concentrate.  I tried another sip thinking that it would grow on me, but no, not one little bit.  I then decided to open up the Goya, cautiously I tried it and I LOVED the coconut pulp and the taste immediately.  I know everyone has different tastes and I will admit that I was never a coconut lover before, but I figured since I have grown to love coconut oil I would be okay, but again, it may be an acquired taste.  My suggestion would be to try a can/bottle of different brands before you give up on drinking coconut water.  I am so glad that I didn't just buy the Zico because I would have signed off on even trying if I hadn't had the Goya right there to redeem itself.",Negativo

I got a new dog about 3 weeks ago and was told she doesn't have allergies at all, her fur was full, skin intact, no redness was apparent when I got her and her feet/paws looked good. The only reason I bought this food (not on Amazon) was because my other dog's stool was looking pretty good on Rachel Ray's Just 6 diet and I purchased in error because I thought it was the same thing. But I looked more closely at the ingredients later on and realized there are many more fillers and now even his ears started getting stinky in the last 2 weeks.  With the new girl, I was steadily switching over her from Science Diet to this poison, I was realizing she seemed more and more itchy and there was a lot of redness and smelly feet. After getting some advice from other dog owners I decided to go cold turkey and switch to Natural Balance LID for the girl and within 4 days of switching foods, itchiness has subsided and feet are less red, inflamed, and stinky. As far as my boy, he is now on a combo of Newman's regular and Wellness grain free, and he loves it and stool looks great.

A true medium roast would have preserved the floral and fruity notes that are present in a good Yirgacheffe.  Otherwise, this is an OK feel good coffee for Senseo and Senseo compatible pod cofee makers.  It is both Fair Trade and Organic certified and promotes or sponsors the coffee kicks charity while trading on the Marley name.

Ah, no.<br /><br />I found that one pod fit the 2-pod holder of my Senseo. Two Marley pods were too large for the 2-pod holder of the Senseo.  I brewed two separate cups, using two pods this morning, but there was no caffeine jolt in this coffee.  A single pod gives a delicious, but slightly weak cup.  Two pods give a very ""Starbucks-y"" cup of coffee with strong flavor, but without their jolt of caffeine. In fact, I needed a third cup of Marley coffee to accomplish what a perfectly ordinary spoonful of Maxwell House Instant Coffee can do any morning of the week when I am in a hurry (but at a cost of around two dollars).<br /><br />If these folks are serious about coffee, they need to take a look at their competition; more flavor and data, less music.

We used a French Press which worked really well.<br /><br />- Flavors may not be for everyone.<br /><br />Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee is a great concept but really fails to deliver on taste.  The first issue arises with the product being in pods.  Many people don't use pod machines.  We used a French Press which worked amazingly well but the pods won't work well in a standard coffee maker.  Our second issue was the lack of overall flavor.  As I mentioned earlier, the coffee taste was more like coffee flavored water than an actual brewed cup of coffee.  Despite the lack of taste, these pods are really handy if you travel or have a French Press at work.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",Negativo

One of my dogs had skin/allergy problems, and the healthy diet with reduced grains and increased omega oils has completely healed her skin and made her coat softer.

The tub of pretzels is basically a little bigger than a half gallon of milk. At any wholesale club, you can get the same amount of pretzels for less than half the cost without the peanut butter. The reason I bought such a large container is because I like snacking on pretzels; seeing that these have peanut butter in them, I decided to try them. On opening these peanut butter filled pretzels: quality is pretty good, nothing wow. The texture of the pretzels are soft and flavorful with a thin crunch, not bland. The peanut butter flavor within is good also, something in between Skippy and generic peanut butter. These little bite sized snacks are filling, about a dozen will hold your hunger. Though, about a dozen gets you a good part of your daily sodium, like many salted pretzels. About 10% of the pretzels in the tub came (before even opening) broken and with crumbs of pretzel bits. Well it's been a little over a month and all that remains are about five handfuls of them left stale and granulated mixed with salt. The peanut butter inside have become dehydrated but still edible.",Neutral

I rarely drink bottled water, but when I do I often find the taste doesn't impress me much. Water is wet, tasteless, hydrating, that's it.<br /><br />I can say, as far as water goes, this Essentia water had zero funny, minerally, chemically taste to it. Pure and tasteless. I did appreciate that. I can't speak to the added pH factor because I'm not really sure what the benefits of that would look like in real time. I suppose if I only drank this water for a month through all the cycling, running and swimming I do I might see a difference, but that is a costly experiment for someone on a budget.<br /><br />All in all, decent bottled water, but nothing supernatural about it that would make me switch from tap.",Neutral

I will tell you the water somehow tastes different (and better) really cold vs. room temperature.<br /><br />After trying this water myself and being unable to conjure up a ""wow"" factor, in order to see if there is a taste difference with this water I set up a ""Water Challenge"" similar to the old Pepsi Challenge with two of my co-workers as follows: I poured equal amounts of cold water in cups containing the Essentia water, water from a Walmart / Sam's-branded bottle of water, and water from the tap that had gone through a filtration device in the office.  The results were incredible - you couldn't tell a difference and the limited test subjects were unable to correctly identify the ""better"" water.  For clarification, the Walmart-branded bottle was first for one participant and tap water was first for the other.<br /><br />In other words, there is nothing wrong with this water.  However, if you look at the cost/benefit analysis of purchasing this water - including shipping from Amazon - the accountant in me just can't say I need to make sure I buy this in the future: it's way too pricey per ounce when, at the end of the day, there's probably nothing wrong with the water coming out of your tap if you have basic filtration on it.",Neutral

After trying this for myself, I suspected that those high ratings were only illusions. My husband told me that company's consider these reviews as just another form of advertising and pay people to lie about a product's quality. I really can't imagine anyone thinking this product is drinkable, let alone, pleasurable. If you want a couple recommendations on decent tasting t-discs for your Tassimo machine, the Jacobs Latte Macchiato isn't bad if you add sugar. This morning though, I drank it after I tried the Voluptuoso and my mouth has a metallic taste to it. Not sure which one is responsible. Another thing, the milk in the disc tastes sour, but when you add sugar, there is a decent flavor there. For the 2nd decent beverage, you can take the Kenco Crema with some Coffee Mate's Spiced Pumpkin and Vanilla Spiced Chai (a liberal amount) creamers, with enough sugar, and have a nice smooth cappaccino. I've tried about nine flavors now, and the coffee, cremas, most lattes and cappaccinos, have the same inferior quality in looks and taste, as a cheap instant coffee, as well as, having your mouth taste like you just drank the contents of an ashtray. Kenco Crema is the only one that did not taste like nicotene. These are the coffees I've tried: Gevailia Cappaccino, Maxwell House - House Blend, Hag Crema Decaf, Jacobs Kronung, Carte Noire Voluptuoso Classic, Kenco Crema and Jacob's Macchiato. After finding one inferior brew after another, I've given up looking for a good cup of black coffee and/or cappaccino, for the Tassimo. Don't do what I did, which was believe all the positive reviews and downplay the critical reviews. My curiousity has been appeased after spending $34 in Tassimo beverages.

The only other things he used with it were a product call Sera Vera and some probiotics. He still needs to watch his diet somewhat, but he has not had loose stools or blood in his stools since he went on this raw organic Manuka honey and Sera Vera routine. Now, if he eats something that does not agree with him completely, he will get gas but no blood or diarrhea. This is a very big relief for both of us. We really wanted to avoid having him go on meds. That is just a vicious circle and we were aiming at curing rather than just controlling symptoms. We seem to be headed in the right direction as we are adding more and more foods back into his diet slowly and he is starting to gain his weight back. He loves the taste of the honey and not only eats it on its own, but also on toast several times a day. It has helped heal his gut, it stimulates his appetite, and it satisfies his cravings for sweets, which is great, because he is not eating any sugar at all right now, because sugar depresses the immune system.<br /><br />I have tasted the honey too and I love the taste.

I thought he had calmed down so we went for a drive, he had a mood swing because I disagreed with him about something, he called himself stupid and started literally PUNCHING his own face while driving!!! He broke his glasses and started crying and gasping for air saying his heart was beating out of his chest. He then proceeded to do 108 MPH with our two young children in the back weaving on and off the road. He made an abrubt stop and got out. At that point I was scared to death and praying he would walk in front of a car. I started to dial 911 on my phone. He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance as police feared he was having a stroke. They said drinking the 5 hour energy on a half empty stomach triggered a response when his saritonin levels started to fluctuate drastically causing possible suicidal/homicidal thoughts and frequent mood swings~ I was 25 years old at the time, my two children were 1 and 4 years old.

I bought these on a whim, thinking they would be good for guests and the occasional time I wanted something a little different.  After trying them, I won't even offer these to a guest in my home.<br /><br />Let me preface a little.  I have the original Keurig, with only one cup size, which is about 7 ounces.<br /><br />The consistency is watery.  There is no richness, no creaminess.  At the same time, the resultant brew is extremely sweet.  It doesn't really taste like white chocolate, more like fake vanilla flavoring.  The only way I can describe this is: non-fat milk, mixed with a LOT of hot water and sugar, with a touch vanilla.<br /><br />I am normally a fan of the Timothy's products, but I definitely won't buy this again.  I hate to waste anything, so I've started mixing one cup of this with a cup of Extra Bold coffee.  That way, at least I'm saving some money on coffee creamer.",Negativo

Since I hate the taste of acesulfame potassium & sucralose I've disliked all the K-cup cocoa varieties.

The packaging is NOT from Britain, it's in a whole 'nuther language, so I opened it and tried it anyways and I PROMISE you, I compared the TRUE cadbury flake to this one and there really wasn't too much difference in taste, you'll find that most chocolate will taste like it may have melted a bit somewhere along the way, UNLESS you pay about $30 extra to send it overnight in a cold package (trust me, I do that often with chocolates from CT to TX)<br />I would (and am again) purchase this, it's still better than (one of my faves) Hershey chocolates and beats the cadbury products we have here.

It was getting tiring doing that by hand, so I found this product and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Here are my thoughts:<br />Pros:<br />It's quite tasty, although very sugary. For me, as I love the taste of ginger drinks (ginger beer, ginger ale) I like the combination of ginger with sweetness, although I would prefer it to be artificial sweetener. I found that I need more than 6 to 8 ounces of water due to the concentration in each of the packets.<br />It's very nice that each packet is individually sealed, which keeps it fresh for quite a while.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It's very high in sugar. It's a peppery, sugary drink. I believe it will supply you with the necessary amounts of ginger to affect your health in a positive way. Here's the but though, because it's high in sugar, it's something that someone like I, who have higher than normal cholesterol would not want to consume too much off.<br /><br />So in conclusion, I liked the taste, but would prefer less sugar, or artificial sweetener.

312559,B002T0NXK8,1,What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer.<br /><br />Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail<br /><br />*Concentrate<br />Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99<br />Liters of product per container 12<br />Flavor/l $0.42<br /><br />*Carbonator<br />Volume of CO2 130<br />Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99<br />CO2 cost per liter $0.23<br /><br />*Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter<br />Equipment cost $89.00<br />Equipment life (years) 5<br />Discount rate (cost of money) 8%<br />Liters per month 10.00<br />Monthly amortized cost $1.80<br />Cost of equipment per liter $0.18<br /><br />*Water Cost with Brita Filtration<br />Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004<br />Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95<br />Brita cost per liter $0.0373<br />Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377<br />(assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration)<br /><br />***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73<br /><br />Without filtered water:<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65<br /><br />*****What does CO2 Really Cost????<br /><br />THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW<br /><br />*Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit)<br />weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs<br />weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2<br />cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35<br /><br />CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams<br /><br />*Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation<br />losses: 10%<br />available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85%<br />net accessible CO2 of total: 77%<br />usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams<br /><br />*Output<br />carbonated liters of water: 2,479<br />cost per liter in USD$: $0.014<br /><br />*SodaStream Output<br />SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product)<br />Cost per refill: $30.00<br />cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231<br /><br />*SodaStream Markup Economics<br />ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x<br />SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534%<br />math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing<br /><br />This is an incredible 1500% markup<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves plastic<br />Allows flexible mixture of flavors<br /><br />Cons<br />Cost of output is not compelling<br />Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs<br />Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit<br /><br />***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times.

As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.

It's actually filling. Sure, if you eat enough of any cereal, you'll feel full after a while, but this is the only one I've found where even a moderate bowlful leaves me feeling quite satisfied, almost like an actual bowl of oatmeal.<br /><br />Another good aspect is that it isn't overly sweet. And of course, it's whole grain and full of fiber, so, whee...it's even somewhat good for you.<br /><br />After having eaten cereal almost my entire childhood, I had lost the taste for it when I got older, and have, over the course of the past 15 years, not really had any interest in cereal products. However, since my 8 year old girl is a bit of a cereal aficionado and there is always random boxes of cereal in the house, I end up eating a bowl now and again. Until I discovered these.

Everything was right, and the recipe was a proven one. All ingredients were measured correctly, the proper yeast (fresh and in perfect condition) was used, and used correctly, but the dough would not come together well, nor would it rise well.<br /><br />My wife also tried to use it in homemade recipes, using our big stand mixer to knead the bread, but that bread also failed. Again, she used proven recipes, but with this flour, had poor results.<br /><br />Finally, we tried mixing it into better-for-bread flour that had proven its worth many times... but even 1 cup (1 cup out of 4) caused the same problems... poor cohesiveness in the dough (where usually when the best-for-bread flour is used, you get a nice velvety ball), and a low flat loaf.<br /><br />The results were consistently bad... no matter where or how (even only mixed in a little into some better flour) or how we used it our breads failed.",Negativo

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",Negativo

I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try.",Neutral

The best way I think I can describe what this cereal is simpilar to would be the taste is more like Trix only not as sweet or flavorful, and they have the consistancy of Honey nut cherrios but much crunchier.  They are so crunchy that it is almost bothersome, to me anyways.  They dont get soggy in milk and are very filling for just 3/4 of a cup.

331145,B008ADQPO4,5,Does not stick to your bedpost overnight,"This is the story of a girl...a girl who went through two sets of braces. A girl who spent most of high school unable to chew bubble gum. Before I got the first set of braces, I was a bubble gum fiend. My favorite Easter candy was that little mini egg carton filled with bubble gum eggs. Still is, to be honest. But after two sets of braces and a TMJ surgery, I was firmly broken of the habit of chewing gum. If I'm offered a piece, I take it, but I don't tend to buy it. But when I do, I buy the bubble gum flavor...is there anything better? It's another one of those flavors I associate with childhood and so this brings up all sorts of good memories, even at first whiff. Bubble gum ice cream, does anyone remember that? The rainbow ice cream filled with little gum pieces...it was two treats in one! Two treats that made two separate royal messes! I also broke my nephew of bubble gum at the age of 3 (he's 13 now). I wasn't thinking and his folks said he could have a gumball, so I gave him one of mine. Filled with Shocktart powder. He won't touch the stuff now, ha! I should feel guilty, but I bet his dentist thanks me for it.<br /><br />Anyway, bubble gum has a very fond place in my heart, and it brings up all kinds of memories. It was another of the new matcha flavors that immediately hopped into my cart and I had to try immediately. And I'm so glad I did. It's definitely the bubble gum ice cream of bubble gum flavors, a rainbow of different tastes and flavors, but under the single heading of bubble gum. Generic bubble gum. Not the teeth-rotting super sugary kind, but the Bazooka Joe kind that loses its flavor too quick. Except this tea doesn't lose any of its flavor. Oh gosh, it's good. My brain keeps trying to make me chew the tea, it tastes so much like bubble gum. I wish I had known about this when I was younger! I keep going back for sip after sip.

I'm impressed, Blue Diamond apparently does a great job taste-wise at gathering and packing nuts! Seriously!<br /><br />By the way, these nuts are not very good when exposed to ambient heat and newly unsealed, as when just delivered at the door here in Arizona where I live. They are somehow less zingy and bland. I am clueless as to the science of this. Let them sit at room temperature for a day, unsealed (but with the lid on), then they become just right.",Positivo

334915,B003WO0I6C,3,Yes.  It taste different.,"I have been using Equal and more recently Splenda, as my sweeteners of choice for many years.  We use it in coffee, tea and on cereals primarily.  My doctor suggested getting away from those artificial sweetners and suggested we try Stevia instead.  We did, and as others have suggested.....it does taste different!  Not sure I would call it an after taste, but different none the less.  It is not a bad taste necessarily, but just differnt.  The effect differs based on what you use it for.  My suggestion would to be to try a small order first to see how you like it, and whether you can live with the change in taste.<br /><br />Addendum Januray 2012:  I am no longer using the Stevia for my coffee or tea.  However, I find that I do not notice the after taste when used on solid foods like my oatmeal or breakfast cereal.  FYI, I find that I need to use three packets of Stevia to obtain the same sweetness of two packets of Splenda.  Also, because this is a fine powder rather than granules, it is more difficult to use.  The packets are made of a sturdy paper product and it is difficult to open it without losing some of the powdery sweetener on your hand, the countertop or in the air.",Neutral

337119,B001ELL27O,5,Wonderful when used as a Cat Treat - like fish flavored cotton-candy for kitties,"While this product is more commonly used to make a traditional fish broth, I have been giving my kitties crushed up Bonito Flakes instead of store-bought treats  once or twice a week for some time now and they couldn't be happier with the switch!  This is all-natural, with no nasty dies for them to blorph up on your carpet and when given in moderation, a dirt cheap treat.  It takes a while for some cats to catch on to the whole idea of a lighter than air flaked treat but once they do, they'll do almost anything to get at the bag so make sure you keep them in a very secure cabinet with a baby-lock!  I gave some as a gift to my neighbors cats and they climbed the counter, pried open the cabinet door, tore into the bag and ate the whole thing in one sitting!  One thing to keep in mind, however, is that what is marketed as ""Bonito"" is in fact, Skipjack Tuna flakes and not the more expensive Bonito.  If these were actual Bonito flakes, the price would be unaffordable.  The reason you'll want to know the actual type of fish is to asses the mercury risk to your little friends.  Skipjack Tuna is considered a moderate risk to pregnant women and should not be eaten by them an large quantities.  Therefore, I limit doling these treats out to about two times a week for kitty and usually just a healthy pinch or two.  it's enough to make them the happiest kitties on the planet for the moment they are smelling and eating their flakes!  My friends call this stuff ""Kitty Kat Krack"" and it's best used as a special treat and not an every day treat.<br /><br />There are two ways to give this to kitty:<br /><br />1. When you get the bag open it up and set aside the biggest flakes to use as training or reward treats that you hand feed to kitty. ABout 2/3rds  to 3/4's of the bag are very large flakes that are good for hand feeding to kitty as a treat.<br /><br />2. Then, fold the open top of the bag over and crush up all the rest into a finer bunch of tiny flakes.  This form is easy to put into a special treat dish for kitty when she's been especially good or to maybe comfort an older kitty who's feeling jealous of a new kitten.  I use the fine powdery flakes in a bowl to lure my outdoor semi-feral kitty inside for health checks and to put his flea meds on.  it works like a charm!<br /><br />I'm very serious about this driving the kitties crazy.  Be sure to put a food bag clip on the open bag or store in a ziplock bag after opening. The smell will tempt a kitty to try and get at it wherever you store it!  I order the 4-bag shipment about 2 to 3 times a year, but I have 3 cats and I often give little snack bags away to friends.  Once or twice a year should suffice for a single cat household.  You may see these in small tenth of an ounce packets in pet stores going for $5.99 so you can see this price is much better.  You can also find this in your grocery store in the Asian foods Aisle but the price per unit can be almost double depending upon where you shop.<br /><br />Try some for kitty!",Positivo

Stevia is a natural sweetener made from the Stevia rebaundiana leaf. It is not an artificial sweetner made with chemicals. It has no unpleasant taste, though people who use artificial sweeteners may take a few days to get used to the lack of ""chemical"" sweeteners. Most people who use Stevia find that they can use less of it than other sweeteners as it's sweetness level is higher per packet.

This was before the U.S. Government-sponsored sugar wars of the 1970s, leading the soft drink manufacturers to use cheaper high-fructose corn syrup instead.

Of course we now know there are other (long term) costs: HFCS probably has plenty to do with the frightening increase in obesity and diabetes in this country. (* recent Princeton study; see link in Comments)<br /><br />Coke's current U.S. offering isn't just bad FOR you. It tastes horrible, too. And despite official Coca-Cola comments to the contrary (""All of our consumer research indicates that from a taste standpoint, the difference is imperceptible""), anyone who has tasted both knows the difference. The suits in Atlanta have a vested interest in protecting their bottling partners on this side of the border. Their apparent failure at the taste test table thus becomes understandable if not acceptable.<br /><br />On the other side of the border, however, Mexican Coke still uses cane sugar, which translates to pure sweetness not to mention less aftertaste. Nice heavy glass bottles add to the appeal. Find these at your local carniceria or bodega, or even by the case at some Costco or Sam's Club locations.<br /><br />REFRESCO indeed!!!<br /><br />P.S. If you are unable to find Mexican Coke locally and unwilling to pay the shipping premium here, just keep your eyes open next Spring for the special Passover Coke, which also forgoes the corn syrup for good old fashioned (and Kosher!) sugar.<br /><br />[+ History Lesson follows]<br /><br />By the late 1970s, increasing tariffs on imported sugar forced U.S. food manufacturers to develop alternative sweeteners.

How close to an actual margarita could they come?<br /><br />No surprises.  It is pretty nasty.  It tastes nothing like a real margarita, which isn't surprising as two-thirds of a margarita's flavor is alcohol-derived.  This doesn't even taste like anything resembling real fruit.  Everything about the flavor screams that this was conceived in a laboratory and not grown on a tree.  Bleah.<br /><br />This is a drink for people who like ""Crystal Light Lemonade,"" ""Kool Aid,"" and ""Sunny Delight.""  This is a drink for people who have become so conditioned to artificial flavorings that they don't know the taste of real fruit juice.  As for me, I will continue to make my lemonade out of squeezed lemons, my orange juice out of squeezed oranges, and my margaritas out of tequila, triple sec, and fresh-squeezed lime juice.",Negativo

342033,B003XUHHLE,5,Don't Believe the Anti-Hype,"I was a bit dismayed to see how low this soup was rated on Amazon after I'd just enjoyed a bowl of it.  Let's go over some of the one-star reviews to address the complaints:<br /><br />1) Some people didn't realize this was soup, or thought somehow it would not be very soup-y.  I suppose if you saw this product in a vacuum you might get confused but on a shelf or web page next to other similarly packaged products it should be very clear this IS in fact SOUP.  It is a light tomato broth with about 6 tortellini in it.<br /><br />2) Some people said the tortellini were rubbery, while others said they are slippery.  Again, I suspect the problem is people who are used to having tortellini in a sauce and not in a soup.  My wife and mother-in-law make a similar soup, homemade from scratch some weekends, and I can assure you there is absolutely nothing strange about how the tortellini in this soup feel or taste.<br /><br />3) Some people complained the tomato broth was ""salty"" while others said it was ""tasteless"".  Obviously it can't be both of those things.  Sometimes I get the sense that people just like to complain when something doesn't exactly match their unreasonable expectations.<br /><br />Overall I found this soup, as a lunch, just barely manages to fill me up, which is amazing since it's something like 90 calories.  It also has surprising flavor considering less than 20% of the USDA recommended sodium intake.  For $2/meal that you can bring to work, leave in your desk, doesn't neet to be refrigerated, can be heated in and eaten out of the can, isn't heavily salted, isn't full of empty calories, and yet tastes good and leaves you feeling reasonably full, I don't think you can find a better option.",Positivo

348693,B004GWSWCQ,4,my fix,"(sorry for the length of this....my first review but I thought my experience would help)<br /><br />The B145 is a commercial-grade model and not intended for home use, as clearly repeated on Keurig's website and on the packaging.  My purchase, and my remedy below, were done at my discretion.<br /><br />I researched Keurigs for several months before pulling the trigger.  We have an original (older) B40 at our office that pumps out 20-25 cups per day and still runs like a champ after years of use.  Since this is a consumer-grade unit, I was optimistic on the projected longevity.  It has the older pump and yes, it makes a fair share of noise which would probably get old running early in the morning.  I read tons of reviews on Amazon and was interested in the quieter B60 or B70 before reading all the stories about pump issues.  After reading reviews and watching Youtube videos on the sound comparisons between old & new pumps, I decided to try the B145.  I ordered it from a popular local office store (with online coupon code...check those out) for a great price.  I knew it would be the noisier pump but wanted the reliability without having to fuss with the pump to keep it primed.  When you want coffee in the morning, you really aren't in the mood to plead with the machine, right?  It arrived the next day and I set it up.  I read a couple of reviews about the B145 not priming for the first time...unfortunately mine was one of those.  I didn't feel like hauling it back to the store and being inquisitive, I figured I couldn't make it any worse by tinkering (my own choice, I'm not suggesting anyone do the same).  Since this model has the drain feature, I managed to get it primed after about 15 minutes of tinkering by doing the following:<br /><br />The unit tried to pull in water but there appeared to have been an air-lock in the line so I held the return nozzle closed while it tried to pull in water.  *** Please note, this machine DOES make substantial noise when it is dry...this is normal with ANY pump that is run dry.  After about 30 seconds of little-to-no water being pulled from the tank, I shut it off, set it for drain and initially held the return nozzle for a second or two while attempting to drain.  It spit some air and a little water into the tank before running empty.  I then reset for an initial prime and watching the water level in the tank, it pulled in a little more water this time.  I had to repeat this sequence about 3-4 times and each time it pulled in more water (and drained when the valve was reversed).  I knew the boiler was full as it was now pulling in the same amount of water during each drain & prime.  I put an empty cup under the spout (no K-cup in the holder) and pressed Brew.  Voila...a full cup of hot water!  *** Please note, once the pump is primed, this machine makes MUCH less noise than when empty.  In fact, it makes alot less noise than our older B40 at the office.  One tip I found was to place a suitable-sized pot holder or rubber mouse pad underneath and the machine does not vibrate anything on the counter.  I've operated both the older and newer models and was pleased to learn that once primed, this model only makes a low hum when running (comparable to the newer style pumps).<br /><br />My opinion is the possible air-lock problem probably affects several models of Keurig brewers, thus the frustrations by owners.  These small bladder-style pumps do not like air bubbles in the supply line, whether it's during initial prime or after months/years of use.  Clearing the air-lock seems to fix every one of the pump-plagued units that have been repaired from what I've reviewed.  My feeling is that if Keurig can implement a fix to keep this condition from occuring on both consumer and commercial-grade models, they would have much happier customers.  The partial-cup complaint can also be due to a clog in the K-cup needle(s), fixed with a straightened paper clip.  Obviously, if you're under warranty, you should consider that route before attempting repairs yourself.<br /><br />I love this machine and have coupled it with an Ekobrew refillable so I can use any coffee variety.  My machine heats up in the morning from cold in about 1 minute, so a timer is not needed.  It has an auto-shutoff option, a descale indicator and three cup sizes to choose from so nothing else is needed.  Even with my initial problem, I wouldn't have made a different choice.  I only gave 4 stars due to the out-of-the-box experience, but now this machine works perfectly!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GWSWCQ"">Keurig B145 OfficePRO Brewing System</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW"">ekobrew Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a>",Positivo

If you can get it cut and on the cake without tearing, it looks great, but it's very delicate work.  Buy 2 the first time you use it, because you will probably need a backup.  I cut out a VERY simple silhouette of a black cat to go on top of an orange Halloween cake and even that simple shape had to be trimmed and finessed because the edges would tear as I was cutting (I used small sharp cuticle scissors).  If you have a Cricut and lots of shapes to cut with, it's probably a lot easier, but I don't anticipate using these enough to justify the expense.  Cool concept- but I think it would work much better if the sheets were a little thicker and sturdier.<br /><br />ALSO- the black will stain your fingers and your tongue (!) when you eat it.

349711,B0012H0ZQE,1,Bland; not the tea you get in Thai restaurants.,"First, I picked this up at my local Asian supermarket because the price there was half what was the price here. Second, I noticed that unlike the other Thai teas, it does not have artificial coloring. All the other Thai teas I found on Amazon and in the Asian supermarket close by had FD&C Yellow No. 6 (Sunset Yellow) which is banned in a few countries due to its carcinogenic effects. I was hoping to avoid that by purchasing this alternative. Unfortunately, this tea is lacking more than just the artificial color.<br /><br />Since I always order tea at Thai restaurants due to the unique flavor and taste, but find the $3.00~4.00 price a bit expensive, I decided to get some so I could brew the same tea at home.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT THAT TEA. In fact, I wouldn't drink this tea at all. I've tried many different types of tea, and this tea is quite possibly of the same quality, if not worse, as ""cheap Chinese restaurant tea"" (watered-down jasmine). Not only does this tea fail to resemble the ""real"" Thai tea in any way, but it lacks any flavor, period. I found that I needed 2 tea bags for a typical, single 6-8oz serving of tea. Even so, it tasted more like generic black tea than the spicy, full-flavored Thai tea that you would expect. For a pot of tea, I needed 5-6 bags. Priced here at $7.99 per box, it is extremely overpriced. $8.00 for 20 bland, half-strength tea bags is a complete ripoff. You could literally get a box of 20 premium fair trade, organic tea bags from Trader Joe's for half the price that these bags are selling for.<br /><br />If you want authentic Thai tea, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005G0F8RY"">Thai Tea Cha Thai</a>. It is a little more expensive, but you receive a large bag and it actually tastes like what you would expect from ""Thai tea.""

Makes a decent hot tea or iced tea, but not at all what I was expecting. I tried brewing a cup with 3 tea bags, as one tea bag is nowhere near strong enough to pass for what I am accustomed to, but it turned out a very strong ordinary black tea. Does not have the reddish orange colour, nor flavour. I used sweetened condensed milk and a bit of coconut palm sugar, following the instructions of the Thai waiters at my favourite Thai restaurant. I didn't want to buy the other Thai teas available on this site, as they are loaded with food colouring and chemical additives.<br /><br />If you are looking for a true Thai iced tea, don't buy this product, or you will be disappointed. If, however, you are looking for a decent black tea for regular hot or iced tea, not a bad choice, though, I personally preffer Scottish breakfast tea for ordinary black tea, as the flavour is very robust, earthy and rich. Rooibus tea is more similar to restaurant style Thai iced tea than this Thai tea.

Also, if you have been told you are gluten intolerant or have decided that gluten is not a healthy food choice and really miss spaghetti with your favourite sauce, then be prepared to have your taste buds challenged slightly.<br /><br />As with anything, it does take a little bit of getting used to and you do have to watch for the 8 - minute cooking time mark and then test often to catch the 'al dente' stage, or the pasta will become claggy/sticky.  The texture is good although you will of course notice the difference between this and regular spaghetti.  I found this product retained heat for longer than standard pasta, which was a nice surprise.<br /><br />Due to the cost, I have decided to use this product for light lunches rather than cook a lot of the packet for a decent-sized dinner, and rendering the amount left for another serving unbalanced, i.e not enough for a portion.

Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because ""it's good for the cats and they love it"". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to ""fatten her up"" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet.",Negativo

It was so delicious that I needed to get some and I decided to order from Amazon as I could not find stores that carry it.<br />This Galil Turkish Delight is so sweet that I could not even eat 2 of them and they are pretty small. I tried to remove some of the powdery sugar, but still the same, which was surprising since it contains pistachio. After eating 2 of them it left me with some kind of sick feeling since they are too sweet. The other problem is that the order comes in 4 boxes, which means that I wasted my money since I could barely consume one box. I took one to the office and the other I gave to a friend of mine, but warned them that it is very sweet. The 4th box may end up going to the garbage as I cannot even think on eating this Galil Turkish Delight again. What a disappointment.<br />I would not recommend this product to anyone.",Negativo

Now, after conglomerate Coca Cola bought them, it's dumbed down: it's now part coconut water (juice) watered down with H2O (water) with unspecified ""natural flavor"" added so you are tricked into thinking your coconut water hasn't just been seriously diluted. Why?  It's cheaper!  They save money by cutting it with plain water.  But it wouldn't taste the same, right?  That's where the flavoring comes in.... To trick you.<br /><br />Zico wont actually specify how much they water it down but you can guesstimate simply by their ads.... They brag this product has 30% less sugar than other brands.  Ok, that means this is likely a 70% coconut to 30% water mixture.  Do you want 100% coconut water or 70% coconut water in your bottle?<br /><br />This isn't the ratio nature intended by the way.

359384,B007M832YY,3,Pop Chips Barbeque Potato Chips,"My local store was running a special on these, so I decided to give them a try.  They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation ""spices"" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.  But since for now it's still there, I'll be steering clear.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012",Neutral

The only problem is the salt is butter flavored so you loose a bit of flavor doing this. I'd say make a batch like normal first and then adjust the salt to taste if needed. That's an easy fix. I save the salt and then I use it for future popcorn making without the kit.<br /><br />If I can find some smaller sample packs to try of other brands, I may look into that in the future when it's time to order more.

369575,B001D0DMME,5,Reminds me of Christmas time when I was a girl. . .,"I couldn't believe my luck. This little nut bar was included in my variety pack of these yummy Kind bars that I had ordered from Amazon last month. The taste and texture of this nut bar is the exact same taste as the beloved ""no bake fruit cake"" that my Nana made us when I was a little girl back in the 50s and 60s. It must be the dates and the particular kind of nuts because it tickles my taste buds in just such a way as to send me back years ago. I thank you Kind bar makers as being genius in your combinations of ingredients. I love these things... Love, love, love. I have just recently made an order with Amazon for a box of 12 of these things... and just when I remembered a book I wanted and decided to add that to my order... gosh, well, I goofed up and I hope that Amazon figures it out for me just in time because if I get all 24 of these nut bars I am in real trouble. I will eat them till they're gone. So, please, cross my fingers Amazon does their usual magic and gets my order just right! I have been invited to ""Like"" them on my Facebook page, but then I don't go there often and... well, if I tell everyone, then they may become hard to find in the future... sorta like telling everyone where your favorite fishing hole is and then not being able to go there because it's so crowded.<br /><br />Computers are so picky!  I offered to write a review of a different flavor of this Kind bar and it told me that only one review per product per customer... but I could edit my review! So, here I am. Back again to further praise and describe what has become my favorite snack food. They are so filling though, you have to watch it because it becomes a meal substitute and then your friends think you're no fun cause you won't eat with them! You're already full! The protein in these bars make them ideal for trail food, however, if you don't have the teeth for nuts, stay away. This last bar I decided I'd praise is the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TNANSO"">KIND PLUS, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate + Protein, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>. I found them in my local grocery store but they often run out and that's what sent me to Amazon for a check on their availability. Yum! Lucky me! So, I'm out. I ate all I ordered last month and I'm daydreaming of them right now. Should've ordered them a week ago so I wouldn't be out now. These dark chocolate bars are so delicious I can conjure up the taste and sensation right now because. . . now here's the heaven part of this daydream. . .they taste like Baby Ruth candy bars from when I would a youth!  Yum, yum, yum.<br /><br />Gotta love it, guilt free candy! But, wait, everyone, it is NOT guilt free if you make it an extra snack, but instead make it part of your meal planning day. The nutrition and calorie info is printed on each bar and if you buy them in the carton, then the info is even easier to read.",Positivo

369786,B000084DWM,1,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",Negativo

I'm spoiled, so I didn't expect much from these dates. I bought them because I have been on a date kick lately, and it was starting to get a little pricy($8.99 per pound) to buy so many organic dates.<br /><br />These dates weren't too bad. My only complaint is the inconsistency of the bag; there were soft chewy ones and tough rubbery ones which were still edible but not as tasty.<br /><br />I love to fill these with pumpkin seed butter and make healthy peanut butter cups. If anyone is looking for a peanut butter cup alternative I recommend Omega nutrition brand pumpkin seed butter, because it tastes most like peanut butter.<br />I slice the date down the center and fill them with the seed butter. Simple, fast, and delicious!<br /><br />$13.49 for a 40 oz of dates? Not too bad :)<br /><br />Update:<br />Two things to report since my review:<br /><br />1. I found a pit in one of the dates. This isn't a problem for me since I always open my dates to stuff them, but someone who is not paying close attention could break a tooth.<br /><br />2. I was saddened that my last shipment of dates was very dry and stale. After 4 bags of moist chewy dates, the 5th bag is dry.<br /><br />I have deducted stars for this issue.

Well, not in the same cup at the same time, but within the same week.  This one can't compare to the mint one.  Maybe since my palate likes black tea over green.  I can smell the great scent of vanilla and ginger, but something is lost in the taste.  It could be that too many flavors are coming to this party.  There are two types of red tea, then green tea and also Assam black tea in this. There are some herbs that make me laugh, like Shank Pushpi and then oddly trademarked ingredients like L-Theanine Suntheanine.  I have to watch this one when it brews. The other one I tried, the mint, doesn't get bitter if you let it brew too long, this one almost has to be brewed at the minimum time stated on the package, which is four minutes, in order for it to taste the best.  I don't like the flavor of this without sugar.  It's a bit too astringent.  Again, that might be the weird mix of green and red teas, along with herbs and ingredients I haven't ran across before now.  It packs even more caffeine than the mint tea, 80mg when a cup of coffee has 90mg.  It's strong stuff.<br />Overall, I got this box to review and will drink it merrily with a bit of sugar in it, watching closely to make sure I don't overbrew it.  I can't use the bags over again, it's way too  bitter.  I don't think I'd buy a box of this because the flavor isn't that interesting to me, even though it has a lot of the spices and herbs I enjoy in teas -- cinnamon, licorice, natural vanilla flavor, vanilla bean, chai spice, ginger -- I don't get why I don't like this as much as I feel I should.  Perhaps there is too much of everything in this tea, making none of the herbs or teas stick out so it is has a lackluster taste.  It isn't horrible, but it's all the memorable either.  It does energize me, but I am not sure if it is because I just drank the tea version of coffee or if I am getting any benefit from the weird mix of herbs, spices and other ingredients.",Neutral

If you don't don caffeine, this is not the tea for you.<br /><br />As for flavor, it is a mild tea with a hint of vanilla and spice.  It is not sweet even though it has stevia in it and I recommend using your favorite sweetener.  I use splenda or agave nectar.  Without the sweetness, the flavor is a little on the light side so don't cheat yourself by a short steep time.  If steeped long enough, and sweetened, it is very tasty and a great substitute for that cup of coffee.",Positivo

I live in a small bedroom community to a larger town, and I really try to stick to foods I can get easily without having to make a special commute into town to go to a pet store. It's about $30 a bag at Walmart - so close to what Amazon charges. I was looking for something slightly cheaper than Iams that my dog would like better. He would often let his breakfast sit until dinner time because I don't think he cared for the Iams.<br /><br />My dog is a 104 lb German Shepherd, so he is a big boy who definitely benefits from a large breed formula. He seems to really like this Purina, he wolfs it down in the mornings now. I like that it's $10 cheaper than Iams, but still a high quality food that has good ingredients. I think the first one is a meat. There are no fillers or soy in it either, which will save on vet bills in the long run.<br /><br />HOWEVER... and this is a dealbreaker... this gives my dog the WORST GAS. Like.... room-clearing gas. It's utterly disgusting. He has it consistently for an hour or two after he eats... and the only word for it is NASTY. It took a couple of weeks of this food before it set in (and nothing else has changed in his diet or habits)... I think I had already bought the second bag of it before I made the connection.<br /><br />We will be switching to a different food. I picked up plain old Pedigree at the grocery store last time I stocked up. It is a much cheaper food, that requires I feed him 50% more by volume for the same weight (6 cups a day versus 4 cups) so that negates any savings. I think the Pedigree was $20 a bag, and the main ingredient is a filler. =/ I didn't know these things when I bought it, I just wanted something, ANYTHING, other than the Purina and it's stink bombs.<br /><br />We will probably be switching back to Iams, alas.",Negativo

There's no ""cup"" to them, just the filter attached to a rim with a seal on it.  So I don't see how these could possibly ""brew"" in the cup like a k-cup is supposed to brew.  I'm betting these are another ""instant"" coffee designed to fit a Keurig brewer.<br />2. The shipment of 3 packages of 12 each that I received was 3 clear plastic bags.  No box as shown on the listing picture.  Now I get it they say packing may differ from that depicted, but IMHO it's dishonest of Amazon to display these online with a box when they know they aren't going to ship them that way.<br />3. Combining #1 and #2 together means once you open the plastic bag of 12, since the individual servings aren't sealed per se, in order to keep them fresh it seems to me you would need to put them in some sort of sealed container.  Not at all user friendly for the many ""carousel"" and ""drawer"" k-cup storage units offered.<br /><br />I do not plan to open and try them at all.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/10/2012: As you can see from above, I wasn't particularly happy with what I received.

That said, I did contact Amazon customer service about my displeasure, and they issued a full credit to my account.  I've been buying from Amazon since 1998, and this is probably only the 4th or 5th time I've requested a refund on a purchase.  Since this is a grocery item, Amazon said they could not accept a return even IF unopened, and the customer service rep encouraged me to keep the coffee and go ahead and try it.  So, I did.<br />I'm happy to report that it is INDEED real coffee (not instant), the aroma is great and the taste is great.  I've upped my rating from 2 to 4 stars.  I do feel justified in knocking the score 1 star for the inadequate description as people need to understand these are NOT ""K-cups"", but they ARE real coffee packaged in a manner different than most would expect when buying coffee for their Keurig. And I still contend that displaying what looks like a nice retail box in the item photo is also misleading.<br />My issue #3 of course remains unresolved, and also contributes to the lower of my rating.

380966,B0026QR76G,3,"I just tried these for the first time, and they fall somewhere in the middle of the pack of Pringles flavors","I like Pringles, and I bought this flavor on purpose, since I like to know what my snacking optins are.  You see, I am a major salty-crispy snack kind of guy.<br /><br />I love chips, cheetos (crunchy), and just about anything that crunches and has salt involved.  I am able to tell how well I like a snack by the degree of vigor with which I attack the snack, and how hard I have to try to stop before I eat the whole thing.  For example, for <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026QR7F2"">Regular Pringles Original, Super Stack</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026QR22A"">Pringles Potato Crisps Super Stack, Barbeque, 6.38-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 14)</a>, or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003URUI4I"">Pringles Cheddar Cheese Grab AND Go!, 2.61-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> flavored chips I look at the side of the can and it says that it contains about 6 servings, and all I can do is laugh.  I know myself well enough to know that left to my own devices that for those flavors of chips that the serving size is one entire can!  But, when I come across a snack that just doesn't do it for me, I find it easy to stop.  It was no problem stopping eating these Honey Mustard Pringles by the time I had eaten about 1/3 or so of a can.<br /><br />I am a BIG fan of honey mustard, but that flavor combined with Pringles worked only adequately for me.  If, however, you like the new onion-flavored Pringles, you are sure to love these.  If not, then these will probably be a bit better for you, but not up to snuff with sour cream and onion, BBQ, or regular flavored Pringles.  The taste of the Honey Mustard variety is a bit flat, but fortunately lacks the rather repelling aftertaste that the Onion flavored Princles have...which is called umami flavor...and that's L-glutamate, the stuff that makes bacon taste so good.<br /><br />Anyway, I have to say that Honey Mustard Pringles are good, but certainly not great, so that falls into the 3-star category for me.  I liked them, ""liked"", but that's all.  So I'll be giving these a miss as long as there are 5-star snacks around.<br /><br />3 stars.",Neutral

Always!  No additives, preservatives....and even no extra sweeteners!  It is<br />also often regarded as a children's beverage -- and to me, that<br />means the manufacturers have taken EXTRA care that the product is<br />as good as can be.  After all, no manufacturer wants to be accused<br />of giving health problems, (now or in the future), or even out-<br />right poisoning, children!  To me, a product specifically made for<br />children, (and/or usually associated with children's eating or<br />drinking it), is often, (but not always), an inexpensive way to get<br />gourmet -- or almost gourmet -- quality food at a good price.<br /><br />I've had Juicey Juice before...and enjoyed it immensely.  But -- the<br />Juicy Juice I have heretofore imbibed was the ""real McCoy"", (no, no<br />-- NOT the Chief Medical Officer of the original Star Ship 'Enter-<br />prise' -- but 'real McCoy"" as in the ""genuine article"".  THAT Juicey<br />Juice, (forget which flavour), came in a large BOTTLE, and had to be<br />REFRIGERATED.  But wow....did it taste good!  : ),<br /><br />Yet, any bottled juice contains a LOT of water.  So -- why not buy the<br />concentrate, and add your OWN water?  It should cost less this way --<br />why spend money on water you can get out of a tap for, (almost) free?<br />(Excluding the ubiquitous water tax, in most instances.)  As I<br />trust only my own, home-made distilled water, buying the concentrated<br />Juicey Juice seemed to make sense two ways -- if not three.  (1. I<br />used my own home-distilled water, 2.) Ounce for ounce, re-constituted<br />concentrate HAS to cost less than juice in big bottles and 3.)  It left<br />more room in my refrigerator....AND on my shelf.<br /><br />For this is not the usual FROZEN concentrate, you see.  It is ""un-frozen<br />concentrate.""  That doesn't need to take up valuable space in the<br />freezer -- or even the refrigerator, at least till it is opened. On top<br />of all this, it is all-natural Juicey Juice.  How could I resist THIS<br />bargain?  How could I miss with it?<br /><br />Well -- as soon as I opened up a can, (admittedly fitted with a very<br />convenient flip-top), diluted it as per instructions, and tasted it --<br />I KNEW I had ""missed"".  And missed Big-Time.  The flavour was absolutely<br />AWFUL!  It tasted as if MEDICINE, on top of the WORST-tasting of CHEMICALS, including a LARGE dollop of MACHINE OIL!  I definitely believe it could send many crewmen TO Dr. McCoy's sickbay on Star Trek.  It surely made ME feel sick!  I was also shocked and saddened.  In oomplete disbelief, I looked at the ingredient label again.  It said:<br /><br />  Apple Juice Concentrate<br />  Water<br />  Grape Juice Concentrate<br />  Natural Flavors<br />  Raspberry Juice Concentrate<br />  Ascorbic Acid, (Vitamin C)<br />  Citric Acid<br /><br />Nope -- nothing wrong with the ingredients.  No motor oil, either. The<br />ingredients -- they were all natural, as always advertised.  And this is a juice usually served to CHILDREN!  Cofusion<br />mixed with great disappointment filled my mind.  I began to wonder<br />about the poisons I have heard that occur naturally.  Poisoned mush-<br />rooms, perhaps?  But no mushroom of any sort was listed amongst the<br />ingredients.....<br /><br />Were my taste-buds going into pre-mature old age, perhaps?  SOMETHING<br />has to go first, according to the popular view.  NOBODY reaches 90<br />without SOME loss of faculties -- or almost nobody, anyway, so most people suppose. I guess I've been lucky in meeting mostly youthfully<br />-minded and spirited 90+ year-olds in my life. But not everyone is that way, even I must admit.  But YIKES....I'm nowhere NEAR 90. (yet, anyway.)<br />I sighed.  Better my taste-buds go first, than my eyes, or my legs...<br /><br />I tried drinking it straight.  Then, more diluted than was called for.  Ulgh, and double ulgh.  Then with the proper 3 cans of water to one can of Juicy Juice dilution.  Ulgh!  No matter how I tried to make it, the flavor didn't improve.  At all.... ):<br /><br />Still disbelieving, I looked again, this time VERY CAREFULLY at the label.  And I noticed something written there I hadn't noticed before.<br />T H I S....P R O D U C T....I S....P A S T E U R I Z E D..( ! )  Not even written in small lettering -- but this notice WAS below all the other information on the label....<br /><br />Pasteurized!  In common slang, ""nuked"". I suppose, being a NON-FROZEN<br />ooncentrate, SOMETHING had to be done to the Juicey Juice to keep it fresh.  I've heard that Vitamin E makes a dandy preservative -- but it probably is MUCH more expensive than nuking -- excuse me, pasteurizing! -- the Juicey Juice.  I mean, pasteurization really doesn't harm the juice, as far as health considerations go.  But -- it DOES make the juice taste like motor oil -- and USED motor oil at that!<br /><br />So, I guess I'll go back to either regular bottled juice, (including bottled Juicey Juice), or FROZEN concenrate.  (As much as admire the tv series ALIEN NATION, with Tenctonese aliens who drink sour milk, eat newspapers, and adore cooking all kinds of bugs -- this unfrozen Juicy Juice concentrate is NOT to my (Human) taste.  Sorry.  Then again -- I wonder if even a fictional Tenctonese, (and former slave), could stomache this stuff either.  Motor oil is NOT something evem the Tenctonese imbibed on the show.......<br /><br />I wish the taste of Juicy Juice Non-Frozen concentrate could be changed.<br />But I doubt whether even a pound of sugar in each 11.5 ounce can could help.  (Before buying this, I was disappointed to see an extra .5 ounce had been eliminated from the usual 12 ounce can.  But after drinking the stuff, I was immeasurably grateful it had been taken off!<br /><br />I knew I could not throw it out.  I had paid money for it, and I was not brought up to be wasteful.<br /><br />Yes, I knew I had bought this....this ....stuff...and the taste was....well, on a score of<br />1-10, it was about a 3...so I knew I could, and would, finish all 12<br />bottles of concentrate, for I was not brought up to waste things.<br />However......no one was telling me I had to drink them quickly.  Pain<br />is sometimes better when it's spread out.  Maybe....I could stretch<br />this stuff out, drinking a few ounces a week, to lessen the pain of<br />drinking it all at once?  Maybe drinking it while watching my favourite cable channel -- the SyFy channel -- would lessen the blow....?  No, I suddenly thought -- drinking this horrible-tasting liquid whilst watching the SyFy channel, of all things, was definitely NOT a good idea.  Maybe....I could take it better watching a comedy?  A musical?  Or better yet, a musical comedy?  Then, THE perfect time to drink this this...juice...came to me.  The time when I felt not worse, not scared -- but at my best.  The day AFTER I file my income taxes!  And maybe on my birthday, and the 4th of July....when my happiness could, perahps, overwhelm the complete awfulness of the taste of this...this...stuff. Maybe I could pass it off on some friends, during a Halloween party?  No -- I like and value my friends to pass THIS stuff onto them.  Hmmm....maybe as a ""gift"", should I ever need to give one, to my ex-brother-in-law?  (This guy once told me: ""You are 6 years younger than I am, and I'll never forgive you for it"", amongst other choice morsels.  He has always had a chip on his shoulder as big as the Grand Canyon.)  Hmmm...maybe not. If I give him THIS, that chip on his shoulder may get as big as a crater on the moon!...<br /><br />It's amazing how GOOD regular, bottled Juicy Juice can taste -- and how totally awful this unfrozen concentrate is.  But at least I know the reason WHY now.  The old poem has it WRONG: ""Their's was not to reason why, their's was just to drink....er, do....or die.""  I looked at the can, and I now KNOW why it tastes so BAD.  (The information about this concentrate being pasteurized is also on the Amazon description of it,<br />but it is NOT highlighted, so it's easy to pass by.)<br /><br />Well, live and learn.

I use the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014CVEH6"">Melitta Ready Set Joe Single Cup Coffee Brewer</a>. The first cup of coffee I made with this was very weak. By dropping the bag directly into the coffee and swishing it around tea bag style, I was able to get a stronger flavor. For my second cup, I just cut open the pod, dumped in the grounds and only let it drip until the color started to lighten. That made for a good cup of coffee.<br /><br />The Marley One Love coffee is an Ethipian Yirgacheffe, which is supposed to be a pretty reputable bean, and it delivers a good coffee. Properly prepared, it is full bodied, with only a slight hint of bitterness - much better than some other highly recommended coffees that I've tried. And the amount of coffee in the packet is just right for a strong standard cup of coffee if you prepare it right - only dripping through until the drip starts to get light. However, it sounds like some people using standard pod coffee makers are getting week coffee and my experience with my first cup indicates the water goes through the pod casing too fast, not giving the grounds a chance to get truly wet so that the water drips through them too quickly and doesn't carry enough of the flavor. So I would say that there's good coffee inside but maybe the delivery process needs work.<br /><br />If you're using a proper pod coffee maker, you're on your own. But if you're looking for something better than the office brew, the contents of the 67 cent pouch are great for using in other single cup setups. 4 stars for the coffee, but 1 star off since it sounds like my roundabout way of making a cup gets better results than the easy way the pod is supposed to provide for.",Neutral

The nutrition label indicated that they are a healthy choice, so I decided to give them a try.<br /><br />My experience with food products targeted toward healthy eaters tends to have two outcomes: they are good tasting and good for you, or they are merely good for you. These La Tortilla low-carb whole wheat tortillas fall in the latter camp. I suspect (based on personal experience, naturally) that when any bread product is reduced in carbohydrates this much and/or has such a high percentage of fiber (as in these tortillas), you end up with food that tastes somewhat like straw. I have bought a number of healthy cereals that had so little flavor as to make me feel like I was eating dead grass. I have also found some real winners at the healthy end of the cereal isle.<br /><br />And LOL at people who think that how many carbs you eat will determine whether or not you lose weight. There is only one method to lose weight: burn more calories than you eat, whatever the source of those calories.

And I certainly do not concern myself with *how many* carbohydrates I consume as opposed to how many calories they contain. No. But I do pay attention to *what kind* of carbohydrates I consume, preferring complex carbs and shunning sugars.<br /><br />For more on what is good to eat and what is not, you might read these books:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743223225"">Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide to Healthy Eating</a><br /><br />and<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0865477043"">What to Eat</a><br /><br />More general information on healthy eating can be found in these books:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470041153"">American Dietetic Association Complete Food and Nutrition Guide</a><br /><br />and<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592574394"">Complete Idiot's Guide to Total Nutrition, Fourth Edition</a><br /><br />P.S.--My favorite tortillas remain the Mission 96% fat-free medium soft-taco whole wheat tortillas.

Their fresh, go-with-everything taste and their smooth, balanced flavor and texture make them the perfect foil for wine and cheese, hors d'oeuvres, etc.  Just pull a tub of cream cheese out of the fridge, spread it on some of these, add celery or bell pepper bits or some thin-sliced deli-meat (or not!), and you have last-minute munchies to hold everyone over while you prepare dinner.  Or lay them out on a platter with some Havarti, Jarlsberg and/or Brie, with a fresh herb or some grape clusters for decoration, and you've got an elegant accompaniment to your favorite red or white wine or cocktail.

392526,B001H9XOEW,2,Not as flavorful or generously sized as other snack bars,"It's hard to review something like a snack bar because a lot of time it comes down to things like personal taste and preferences, but I'll try to do it as much justice as I can<br /><br />The strawberry soy joy bar has a texture that reminds me of a dense version of a nutrigrain bar, minus the filling.  It's full of fruit chunks and has a strong, fruity floral flavor.<br /><br />What I like most about these bars is that their 130 calories make them perfect for a snack, unlike many bars that are higher in calories and fat and more of a meal replacement.  It also has 3 grams of fiber and 4 grams of protein which I consider sufficient for a snack.  They do a relatively good job of tiding me over until the next meal or beating the afternoon munchies.<br /><br />That said, there are some things I do not care for, which are the reason I give them 3 stars.  The first is that visually they seem incredibly tiny for the calorie count, which makes them less satisfying in a way.  I compared them to my typical Luna bar and was surprised to find it was only 50% bigger (weight wise) than the Soy Joy bar.  Visually it looks much bigger but I'm wondering if this has to do with how dense the Soy Joy bar is.  The second is that I didn't really care for the flavor.  It was too sweet compared to things like a Luna, Odwalla, or Lara Bar, but probably on par with something like a Nutrigrain bar.  I also couldn't really tell that the flavor was strawberry.  It mostly just tasted sugary.  There were also a lot of ingredients in the bar that I couldn't taste at all.  The label mentions chocolate chips and pineapple but I couldn't taste these at all, just a generic kind of sweetness.<br /><br />Another thing worth noting is that it is not enriched with any vitamins like a lot of meal and snack bars.  This isn't a concern to me since I attempt to eat a varied and balanced diet, but does make this bar different than something like a Luna Bar that is typically enriched with a lot of vitamins and minerals.  Overall this just wasn't a bar I cared for very much.  It seemed so small for the number of calories and just tasted generically sweet and dense.<br /><br />The bottom line is that taste is subjective and you may like these bars even if I do not.  However, in my opinion I find the flavors of bars like Luna and Odwalla to be closer to what the description says and more satisfying overall.  However if you don't care for those bars and are looking for something different this may be closer to what you are looking for.",Negativo

And once you've made one quesadilla casserole, you don't have to buy the packets again. Why? Well...see below.<br /><br />First, consider the price ($6.99 at the current time). That's hefty for a few teaspoons of seasonings! By the way, I've also tried Mccormick Recipe Inspirations for Rosemary Roasted Chicken with Potatoes and while it was delicious, I didn't need to Inspirations package to create the exact same meal the next time around.<br /><br />Why? Because McCormicks lists each ingredient (in that case, paprika, crushed rosemary leaves, garlic and ground black pepper) and even notes the required amount of teaspoons to use for each spice or seasoning. So all you really have to do is save the back of the Inspirations packages and you can create the same meals - at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />Yes, it may cost more the first time you purchase an entire box or jar of spices. But you'll end up saving money in the long run because they'll last far longer, making them far more economical.

398962,B001D09KAM,5,Reminds me of Christmas time when I was a girl. . .,"I couldn't believe my luck. This little nut bar was included in my variety pack of these yummy Kind bars that I had ordered from Amazon last month. The taste and texture of this nut bar is the exact same taste as the beloved ""no bake fruit cake"" that my Nana made us when I was a little girl back in the 50s and 60s. It must be the dates and the particular kind of nuts because it tickles my taste buds in just such a way as to send me back years ago. I thank you Kind bar makers as being genius in your combinations of ingredients. I love these things... Love, love, love. I have just recently made an order with Amazon for a box of 12 of these things... and just when I remembered a book I wanted and decided to add that to my order... gosh, well, I goofed up and I hope that Amazon figures it out for me just in time because if I get all 24 of these nut bars I am in real trouble. I will eat them till they're gone. So, please, cross my fingers Amazon does their usual magic and gets my order just right! I have been invited to ""Like"" them on my Facebook page, but then I don't go there often and... well, if I tell everyone, then they may become hard to find in the future... sorta like telling everyone where your favorite fishing hole is and then not being able to go there because it's so crowded.<br /><br />Computers are so picky!  I offered to write a review of a different flavor of this Kind bar and it told me that only one review per product per customer... but I could edit my review! So, here I am. Back again to further praise and describe what has become my favorite snack food. They are so filling though, you have to watch it because it becomes a meal substitute and then your friends think you're no fun cause you won't eat with them! You're already full! The protein in these bars make them ideal for trail food, however, if you don't have the teeth for nuts, stay away. This last bar I decided I'd praise is the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TNANSO"">KIND PLUS, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate + Protein, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>. I found them in my local grocery store but they often run out and that's what sent me to Amazon for a check on their availability. Yum! Lucky me! So, I'm out. I ate all I ordered last month and I'm daydreaming of them right now. Should've ordered them a week ago so I wouldn't be out now. These dark chocolate bars are so delicious I can conjure up the taste and sensation right now because. . . now here's the heaven part of this daydream. . .they taste like Baby Ruth candy bars from when I would a youth!  Yum, yum, yum.<br /><br />Gotta love it, guilt free candy! But, wait, everyone, it is NOT guilt free if you make it an extra snack, but instead make it part of your meal planning day.

This product is made from 100% Arabica beans which seem to be roasted to a full city roast, or thereabouts.  Illy Issimo is produced in Denmark under a collaboration between illy and Coca Cola.<br /><br />Let me also be clear that my rating has nothing to do with the cost of this item.  You'll have to make a value determination on your own.  While I do a lot of shopping at Amazon, I purchased this item at Big Lots for less than a third of the current price at Amazon.

On a particularly hot day, I stopped for gas and saw these in the cooler at the gas station, so I purchased one. How refreshing! It is the perfect drink to enjoy on a hot day while driving. It truly hit the spot, and unlike other brands of canned coffee beverages (including Starbuck's), this one has an authentic coffee flavor with the perfect balance of milk and sweetener.

I generally drink coffee with half and half with or without a sweetener. Marley coffee could be compared to a strong brew of coffee house coffee such as Caribou but without the bitter taste or the hollow taste I find in many of the coffee house brews. The Marley coffee is very strong with that tingling sensation in the mouth but does not have the bitter taste. It is very rich and smooth. This is one of the few coffees that I would likely drink black because it lacks the bitterness but has a strong flavor. It is very likely the best coffee I have ever tasted. It is not cheap.

420759,B0002I0GUY,1,A sub-par version of store bought Wellness,"We've been buying this exact formula of Wellness for our Cocker Spaniel ""Lucy"" for over a year now.  We thought that it would be worth purchasing on Amazon since it was priced almost identically and it would be more convenient than going to Petsmart since it would be delivered to our front door.  We didn't receive the food for well over a week after we ordered it so we were forced to buy a small bag at the store until we received the food.  No big deal...we figured next time we'll just order it a couple of weeks in advance so that Lucy's food supply isn't as low and we have plenty until we get the next bag.  After feeding her two meals of the bag we got from Amazon, Lucy started having violent diarrhea.  I'm familiar with the fact that changing foods can cause an upset stomach with dogs but this is the exact same food we have been feeding her for a very long time.....or so we thought.  We knew that the only thing that changed in Lucy's diet was the fact that we ordered the food from Amazon.  So we went and bought another small bag of the same stuff from Petsmart.  Much to our disappointment, there was an obvious difference in the appearance of the food.  The bag from Amazon had chunks that were misshaped, very porous and even smelled different.  Our conclusion was that Amazon received the reject bags at a discount and sold them as the same product.  We then stopped feeding Lucy the Amazon bag and switched her back to the store bought bag.  Immediately her bowls improved.  Although we were refunded for our purchase we had to jump through a few hoops that weren't worth the time we wasted to do so.  Please reconsider before you purchase this food.  Wellness is an Amazing product and we're proud to feed our little Lucy the best food that we possibly can but this is not up to the quality that Wellness is known for.  I'm going to post pics of both the Amazon bought food and the Store bought food so that you can see the difference.",Negativo

423469,B005VOONGM,4,Tastes pretty good!,"Before I go any further in this review, I have to admit that I initially didn't know that this came in pods when I requested it. For whatever reason, I missed the pod image in the picture, so when I received this I ended up using several pods to create a full pot of coffee. This did impact anyone who is wondering what it might be like to brew one individual pod, which I will try to brew with my father's french press. Anywho, on with the review. I just wanted to be up front when I say that my experience might not be like that of someone who owns a Senseo.<br /><br />Smell-wise, this stuff is awesome. It smelled great when I was brewing it, which is honestly about 30-40% of what I (and many others) enjoy most about coffee. Taste-wise, this was pretty good. It's definitely a dark roast, so if you prefer a more mild flavor then you'll probably want to look elsewhere. (Not sure if Marley coffee has a lighter roast, but they probably should.) It's not Charbucks, so no worries about it being too roasted.<br /><br />I brewed this at work and after the pre-requisite jokes about a ""pot"" of coffee and such, we all set about to consuming it. Now while we do have to put up with some of the worst free coffee possible, it only serves to help us appreciate the good stuff when it comes along, and this is some good stuff and was pretty well received. I had a lot of people that came back and told me that they really enjoyed the brew. (For food items, if I can get a wider opinion, I try to do so because hey- not all opinions are the same when it comes to any product.) So if you have a Senseo that multiple people use or if you're considering buying a regular bag for multiple people to use, this is something you can get for a wide audience of drinkers.<br /><br />I have to say, this is something that I'd actually purchase with my own money later on down the line. It's a good coffee and while I don't base my purchases on the whole ""organic, fair trade"" stuff, I know that others do and I have to admit that it is nice to think that the coffee purchase potentially helped someone other than myself.

423850,B0001BV0LG,5,One of the best root beers available,"First of all, for most people a birch beer and a root beer are almost the same thing. The taste is similar, and birch root is used in many products labeled as root beer. This company also bottles another soda called root beer, but this tastes better. It has a touch of wintermint in the complex flavor, spices, and vanillas. Nice  creamy texture on the tongue, less carbonation than most, which is good since it allows the flavor to come through. Yet it still has a nice foamy head.  They did not use high fructose corn syrup,  but chose cane sugar as their sweetener. It is more expensive but you can weigh down a soda with the corn syrup. So without it it is lighter and more refreshing.  I have to warn you, you may get spoiled if you drink Boylan's sodas as they are not cheap, but very addictive.<br /><br /> Originally brewed in 1891, this New York classic has the same flavor as it did over a century ago.  Boylan's Birch Beer started in a apothecary in the early 1890's and developed into the most popular flavor of The Boylan Sodaworks. Boylan was a bottling and keg filling operation located in the heart of Paterson, NJ, the first industrialized city in the country. Competition increased however, and in the 1930's Boylan was forced to close its bottling lines, leaving Boylan's Draught Birch Beer as its only product. Shortly thereafter, the rights to the name, the formula, and the sole route was purchased by the driver.

No more fiddling with messy cans or figuring out longterm storage. However, these thoughts were soon dashed after bringing the product home. The taste was ""off"" somehow.

The individual K-Cups were just thrown around. The bottom of the box had a good amount of coffee grinds. I don't think the post office is responsible for the mishap because the box didn't appear damaged. The only logical explanation is the damage originated where the K-Cups were loaded into the box. Five out of the 50 K-Cups were unusable. If you don't think 10 percent is a big deal, then imagine going on a blind date and your blind date answers the door and you notice he/she is missing 10 percent of his/her teeth! See, 10 percent is a lot. Bottom line, I'm not ordering K-cups on-line anymore. I guess I'll just get of my butt and head down to the store. It will be worth the extra expense.<br /><br />Arthur M.

426298,B003BJOORW,1,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",Negativo

My daughter still seemed excited to try them though, but then she made a horrible face and actually shuddered.  I tried a second spoonful in case she just needed a minute to get used to the flavor, but my normally adventurous eater (who begs for things like edamame and feta cheese) refused to take it.  The only other thing she has rejected that way were jarred baby food green beans (but she likes steamed/pureed green beans).  And then I tried it (and wished I had tasted it first to begin with) and they were just awful.  To me they only tasted vaguely like peaches - bland, slightly sour, and even a slight bitter aftertaste.  I've never had any fresh, canned or frozen peaches that have tasted like that before and I'm particularly sorry that I got a case before trying just one.  Ah well, live & learn and come summer I'll be able to feed her the real thing.

Terrorizing the ancient villagers was not enough - he formed a cult of horrid worshipers whose tounges had to be cut out so that they could drink of his blood and gain some of his power.<br /><br />Sriracha was challenged by Atlanta, the Water Serpent of the West, and defeated in a battle lasting three hundred years and ending on Cinqo de Mayo.  On his death he dissolved into a giant bowl of tasty, yet spicy chile paste which was gathered by his followers and put into a temple in the Himalayas to be guarded for his return.  It is to this day bottled by the Tongueless Monks of Tuong Ot and shipped to the uninitiated so that his soul can be spread out among the world to effect his return.<br /><br />Last night, Sriracha was reborn into the world.  At 3:00am, my stomach weakened by ibuprofen taken to prevent a headache, Sriracha found new life in the pits of my bowl.  A horriible pain - his unholiness pecking through my gastric wall no doubt - jolted me awake.  I finally passed out, probably from blood loss.

432644,B003MWBFXY,3,"Expensive, but it worked!","I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with ""meal"" of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.  The other two have not gained weight with this product, and their appetite does not appear to have increased at all.",Neutral
432655,B003MWBFXY,1,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",Negativo

433291,B004DBT12A,3,"Drinkable, but rather bland, not full-bodied, will not buy again","I have been a Keurig user for several years, have one at home and one in my office. For at least 4 years I have been using the Green Mountain Columbian Fair Trade K-cups, been very happy with them. Recently I saw the Donut House flavor offered at my local warehouse club and it piqued my interest, problem is that the warehouse box contains 80 K-cups, didn't want to buy 80 of something I may not like. So, I picked up an 18-count box at my local Walmart, I'm so glad that I did!<br /><br />First, let me say that I'm not a fan of Starbucks coffee's, I think they are too strong, too bold, too bitter. I like a flavorful, medium roast but full-bodied cup of coffee. The Green Mountain Columbian Fair Trade K-cups fit this bill, whenever I would make a cup at my office, everyone would comment, ""Wow, that smells so good!"", it tasted just as good.<br /><br />I tried the Donut House coffee this morning, no inviting aroma when brewing, very bland in taste, I don't know how they get away with calling this ""Bold"". It says right on the box, ""light roast"", I don't know how a ""light roast"" can be called ""Bold""? I was expecting a very full-bodied flavor, but without a bitter after-taste. Well, there was no after-taste, no taste period, just very bland!<br /><br />FYI, I usually use 16 oz. ""to go"" cups when brewing K-cups, I use 2 K-cups per 16 oz. cup, I brew the first K-cup on the middle button (8 oz. setting), the the second K-cup on the lowest setting (I think it is 6.5 oz. setting), this allows room for a teaspoon of sugar and some half and half to a golden color. I have been doing this for years with my Columbian K-cups and always get a great cup of coffee, did the same with the Donut House blend, drinkable, but not remarkable in any way. I will be sticking with my Columbian Fair Trade blend that never fails me.<br /><br />I will use the remainder of my Donut House K-cups, but I will not buy them again.",Neutral

433901,B006BXV14E,3,Flavor is definitely reminiscent of cinnamon rolls. Sugar seems bordering on excessive...,"I'm something of a shredded wheat fan. Generally my favorites have tended toward post honey nut shredded wheat or possibly the Kashi cinnamon shredded wheat. Though of late I've rather preferred it plain, as I'm trying to cut back on sugar consumption.<br /><br />All said, the falvor of this is what I says it is. It definitely tastes like cinnamon rolls. But, on the other hand it seems rather excessive on sugar at 12g/cup, so probably on the order of 12-20+g/bowl, depending how big a bowl you prefer. To me that seems pretty unbearably sweet after having been off sugar for some time.<br /><br />I don't know whether the ""little bites"" (that is squares about half the usual size) add or detracts from the overall appeal. Not sure why the bites need to be mini-er than the usual bite-sized shredded wheat already available...? Maybe for kids? To compete with other small cereals like Cheerios or Golden Grahams? Hard to say. Didn't do much for m one way or the other.<br /><br />If you like sweet cereals, and or really crave the taste of cinnamon rolls, this might be for you. If not, well, I suppose you could take it or leave it depending on your tastes. I'll probably stick to plain shredded wheat of health reasons. But, overall, it wasn't bad. If I was still into sweet cereals I might like it more than some others I've had. Though, again, I tend toward more lightly sweetened things than heavy-handed sweetening, generally.",Neutral

The first half of the bowl was pretty good, but as the milk soaked in the cinnamon flavor quickly disappeared and I was was left eating wheat. It tasted bland and just blah. But, like I said the first half of the bowl was decent until the flavoring wore off.<br /><br />Then, as with most mini wheat cereals I tried it straight from the box. The taste that way was much stronger and more enjoyable, but I am not one that eats this type of food directly from the box so I don't see myself enjoying that.<br /><br />All in all, it was an ok cereal for me. I'm not sure I would purchase it again, or if I did it would be a every 6 months or every year just so I remember why I don't get it more often.",Neutral
433950,B006BXV14E,3,"Good, but that serving size is annoying","Lately, I have been trying to eat lean protein for breakfast.  That means egg whites and greek yogurt.  While both delicious, these can get a little boring for breakfast.  Once in a while, I just want a bowl of cereal that tastes like it is bad for me, but in reality is not.  Enter Frosted Mini Wheats.<br /><br />This is a cereal brand that I have enjoyed for a long time.  They make several different flavors, and frosted wheat is not that bad, considering it is a great source of fiber.  Food purists might not like the amount of sugar in the frosted wheats, but all in all, not an awful choice for a once in a while breakfast treat.  So, when I learned there were Cinnamon Roll flavored Mini Wheats, I knew I had to try them.  Cinnamon Roll flavored stuff has been a recent obsession, so that I get the flavor of a comforting treat without the fat.<br /><br />I did not realize the difference between Mini Wheats and Mini Wheat Little Bites until I saw them.  These are much tinier than regular Mini Wheats, hence the slight name difference.  Were the Minis not mini enough? Otherwise, these are your standard Mini Wheats.  They look a little like straw, but I truly think they are tasty.<br /><br />Nutritionally, they are not awful, but higher in calories and carbs than I would like.  However, a great source of fiber and very low fat.  So, for a once in a while thing, once again, not awful.  My biggest complaint is the serving size, which is 47 biscuits.  Really?  You could not have just made it half a cup?  For people who are a little OCD about precise serving sizes, it is a major pain to sit there and count out 47 biscuits each time I want to make sure I am getting a correct serving size.  It is a major flaw as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />Taste wise, these were good, not fantastic, but good.  But between the annoying serving size and the amount of calories and carbs, I am not sure this would be a staple in my pantry.  I think there are better, healthier, easier options out there. And if I were going to splurge with carbs for mini wheats, I would probably do it on the blueberry ones.",Neutral

I do use these pods though, in my cooking.  They serve as a wonderful way to flavor stock and I'll simmer them when preparing different meat dishes.

If you want your beverage to taste more like a weak flavored water, use less--if you want a more pronounced taste use more.  I found in my trials that a few drops are too little, and a squirt can be too much.  I like my drinks to taste like someting, so I've used more.  The sweetness is a bit overpowering; but using less results in a weak drink that I found unpalatable.  I suppose this product is best for those who want tepid tasting flavored water, in that case a few drops would suffice and a bottle would last quite a while.  I found it to be very artificial tasting and not as good as those drink pouches you put in a bottle of water.  The only really good thing about it is that since it is a liquid, it dissolves readily in your bottled water whether the water is room temperature or cold.

The newer version, while they claim it offers more calcium (which is great), has caused the product to be extremely messy.  I know it sound minor, but when the ENTIRE area surrounding the container or bag is completely covered in dust, you will be annoyed.  In addition to the mess, the additional powder/nutrient essentially cut down the amount of food in the bag since the weight did not increase. When I scoop out a portion now, it is hit or miss as far as whether I am going to get 60% or more powder & I worry about the caloric intake my dogs are or are not getting now.

I hope they come up with a decaf version since this has 50 mg of caffeine--too much for me!<br /><br />White tea has the highest level of antioxidants of all teas.  Supposedly antioxidants reverse damage done by free-radicals to tissues of the body. Free radical damage can be caused by pollution, radiation, smoking and the aging process. Reversing this damage is supposed to reduce effects of aging and disease. Some say that antioxidants help prevent heart disease, alzheimers and cancer.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. They put a caffeine meter on the box to compare this tea with cola and coffee beverages-this tea has 50 mg of caffeine compared to 90 in a cup of drip coffee. The level of antioxidants and information about them would be a good addition.",Positivo
446371,B000GZSDZI,1,Product has slid downhill. Inconsistent in quality.,"I've purchased about 5 cans per month of this for about 14 months. At first, this was a wonderful product.<br /><br />Later, I started finding the bad can occasionally - where the taste was akin to either the product having a metallic reaction with the can, or the product tasting like it had gone bad. But it didn't happen often enough to make me quit buying it.<br /><br />In the last few months, I've purchased more bad cans than good ones. I've written to their company, and called, numerous times. They don't seem too interested in my findings, sadly.<br /><br />Just now, I read another reviewer's comments stating that Thai Kitchen was bought out about a year ago. That seems to coincide with when my dis-satisfaction with the product began. Not only is the taste often bad; but formerly there would be a nice thick lump of cream at the top of the can, and a bunch of thin watery milk at the bottom - as one would want.  Now, however, the product is as thin as coffee creamer all the way through. It never thickens upon refrigeration, either. Clearly, there is NOT as much fat in the product as formerly. So disappointing!<br /><br />I wanted a product without sodium metabisulfate - which is a huge allergy trigger. The other recommended brands like Chao Koh have the sodium metabisulfate. Thai Kitchen does add guar gum, but I can live with that. If only they could keep their quality consistently good!<br /><br />I'm testing A Taste of Thai presently, which is more coconutty tasting, but is very thin and I'm not sure if I like the taste yet (there is an extra fruitiness that I can't quite identify and it is a little overpowering.)<br /><br />It shouldn't be this hard to get a good prepared coconut milk!",Negativo
446408,B000NX0MF2,2,The first disappointment for me from Jyoti,"As someone who loves Indian/Bangladeshi food, I have been trying various JYOTI foods, given the good reviews here on amazon.<br /><br />Well, this is the third item I tried and I didn't even finish my serving. I found a rather offputting flavor in the stew/soup. Maybe it's the tamarind. Not sure. (And I say this as someone from the Caribbean who used to eat tamarind sno cones and as of last year had some homemade tamarind honeyed-juice my sister made--she has a tamarind tree. I'm not anti-tamarind.)<br /><br />Whatever it was, this was not like ANY lentils or lentil stew or lentil soup I've had in assorted Indian restaurants in the last 30 years. It tasted overly earthy and odd. Maybe I just got a bad batch. Dunno. But I wish I could be as enthusiastic and give a thumbs up like the others here. I do. But I can't. I really didn't love this.<br /><br />I'm gonna open another can later on and try again. But this has been the one major letdown for me from Jyoti. I almost made this one star, but since I give room to the fact that the problem may lie with a batch or with something askew in the can I opened, I'll leave it at two stars.<br /><br />Now, I'm afraid to try another Jyoti from amazon. I may head to my local Indian supermarket and see if they have the saag and try one can. After this experience, I won't pay for a whole case again. Bummer.",Negativo

I saw this at Whole Foods today and thought I'd give it a shot. Those who say it has a very strange odor and/or taste probably aren't familiar with nutritional yeast, which is one of the main ingredients and what makes it so strong-smelling. I added about 3/4 cup unsweetened plain soy milk and 1 1/2 tablespoons of organic Smart Balance (lower calorie earth balance, also vegan). I cooked the sauce in a separate sauce pan and added it to the drained pasta after it had cooked and thickened a bit. I also added maybe 1/2 teaspoon of mustard. Sauce was very creamy, but not big on flavor really. I ended up adding salt, cayenne pepper, and after all else failed, threw in maybe 1/3 cup of pepperjack daiya (don't usually buy that stuff either so it was lucky I did today!). After the addition of a little Daiya it was really good. It was relatively cheap for being a vegan cheeze product, I think like $2.00 or so. I will probably buy it from time to time, but I can't give something that came in a box a 5 star review when I had to add so much to it (and change the cooking instructions!)

Well, went to Whole Foods a few days ago and happened to notice this stuff on the shelf.  Reading the ingredients, i was glad to see it did not contain soy, and some of the ingredients were similar to what is in DAIYA.  I bought 2 boxes and eagerly awaited trying it.  So, made it tonight with 1/2 cup organic plain Rice Dream, and 1 TB soy-free Earth Balance spread.  My husband spit it out.  But he is FAR from being a vegetarian or a vegan, so take it with a grain of salt, lol.  However, my three little mac and cheese addicts (meaning my 3 little boys age 3, 5, and 7), loved it.  By the time I served myself some, it was cold so I put it on a paper plate and zapped it for 50 seconds.  Well, guess what?  Zapping it made the sauce thicken into a rich texture (without zapping it was thin/watery), and I LOVED LOVED LOVED it.  It even tasted kinda like a light cheddar cheese!

450631,B00008MOIF,1,"It's cheap, and it's bad for your cat.","I was raised in a house that always had at least one cat being fed Meow Mix. Owning my own cat now, I've done some research on available food choices. Meow Mix is one of the cheapest--and one of the worst.<br /><br />Not quite like humans, cats will eat until they are nutritionally satisfied *or* full. The problem with cheap brand cat foods is that they use synthetic products, carbohydrate-based fillers, and processed meat by-products. Cats are obligate carnivores. The first two ingredients on Meow Mix's list (the ones used in most abundance in the product) are corn. As a result, cats are getting fewer needed nutrients per serving, causing them to eat until they get full and to eat more over the course of the day.<br /><br />Healthy food results in a healthier cat. Weight control, shedding, disease development, and more are all influenced by a cat's food. The excessive use of carbohydrate-based fillers in cheap cat foods, as part of this reality, can lead to weight gain and a higher risk of diabetes.<br /><br />Brands sold in quality pet stores start with Iambs as the ""baseline,"" and even Iambs isn't what I'd call good for your cat. Many of my local shelters feed their cats Iambs as the least expensive acceptable cat food. Even better, companies such as Orijen and EVO make premium cat foods made with very little or no grain content, which are ingredients cats would not naturally eat. Whatever you decide, check the ingredients list. Make sure some kind of meat is listed as the primary ingredient with other meats as close to the top of the list as possible. Also make sure those are actual meats. Meats are better then meat meals, and meat meals are ok (and usually unavoidable). Meat by-products are what you want to watch out for.<br /><br />The reality is that your cat is not biologically designed to eat a diet consisting mostly of corn or grain. Healthy cat food is more expensive, but your cat will eat less of it, helping to mitigate the cost a bit. I recommend premium cat foods for this reason. They're better for your cat in every conceivable way, and they won't break your bank. Even if you are on a budget, consider the cost medical concerns due to obesity or diabetes could incur. If you are currently using this food, maybe it's time to switch.",Negativo
450632,B00008MOIF,2,"Very cheap, poor quality","I've had my cat for four years now, and I've almost always fed her Meow Mix because its inexpensive, and its what my family used to buy to feed her and other cats we've had in the past. Since she seemed to favor it, I continued to feed it to her after I had moved out of the house, taking her along with me. Although I'd clean up her messes before, she tends to vomit almost all the time (or maybe I just notice it more?)<br /><br />What I've come to realize that she vomits up this food at least once or twice a month. Once I did some research on cat nutrition, and then looked at the ingredients in this food, its really not what you want your cat to be eating...<br /><br />I know it'll be more expensive, but I'd rather give my cat something that she can digest and enjoy, with quality, than give her something cheap that makes her sick.",Negativo

I used a dozen cans of this dark fishy smell *venison and rice* and then ordered another case.  I opened up a can of the new case and it was back to the gray-pink food!  The dates for this new case showed it was manufactured after the dark fishy smell venison and rice.  That made me question what on earth my cat has been eating!

455394,B005HG9ERW,3,"An okay filtered municipal tap water with slight ""chalky"" aftertaste, but the misleading health claims and hype are quackery!","Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:<br />*** Somewhat recommended, with reservations and only lukewarm fuzzies.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />+ Not too expensive compared to other bottled water, although it is not cheap either.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />- This bottled water product's labeling, product descriptions, and health claims are misleading.<br /><br />At first glance, this 1.5-liter bottle of water that I am reviewing looks like another one of the many varieties of bottled water on the market.  There are many kinds of bottled water: ""spring water"" produced from an underground formation where the groundwater naturally flows up to the Earth's surface, ""artesian water"" obtained from a well that taps into an underground aquifer, ""mineral water"" produced from a well or spring that naturally contains trace amounts of minerals that some people consider to provide health benefits, ""ground/well water"" produced from a well that tapes into an aquifer, ""sparkling water"" from a spring or well that is naturally carbonated, and ""purified water"" produced by distillation, deionization, reverse osmosis, or other purification processes.  This Essentia Drinking Water is ""purified water""; this bottle contains municipal water (i.e. tap water that comes from your faucet) that is purified using reverse osmosis and ultraviolet light for disinfection.<br /><br />The label on this Essentia water bottle is filled with marketing hype and technical terms designed to make it sound exotic:<br />* ""Infused with Electrolytes For A Difference You Can Taste""<br />* ""Silky Smooth Taste""<br />* ""Hydrates Better""<br />* ""Electrolytes Infused""<br />* ""Best Available pH at 9.5""<br />* ""Doctor recommended to protect, improve, and enhance the quality of your health.""<br />* ""Our Proprietary Technology: Water purified by reverse osmosis; infused with electrolytes for taste; alkalinized and restructured using Ionic Separation Technology.""<br />* ""Ingredients: purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, calcium chloride.""<br /><br />There are two ways to evaluate this water product.  One way to review this water is based on how it tastes, how safe are its added ingredients, and its cost.  Since Essentia includes a variety of health claims and marketing statements on the water bottle's label, on the Amazon product listing, and on the company's Web site, the veracity of this statements must also be scrutinized since the marketing hype of most other brands of bottled water is just limited to the ""freshness"" or ""purity"" of their taste without making other health-related claims.<br /><br />First, on the basis on its cost, with all of its marketing hype and hoopla, at least this water is not priced far more expensive than most other brands of bottled water.  But there are various other bottled water products on Amazon that cost less on a per-liter basis.  And if you think that this slightly pricey water can be justified based on its health ""merits"", keep reading...<br /><br />As for taste, that can be a highly personal preference, but I like my water to simply taste ""wet"".  :-)  If I want some kind of flavored drink - tea, wine, beer, fruit juice, etc. - I will drink that instead.  But nothing hydrates and quenches as easily as pure and simple water, with no additives or flavorings added to it.  This particular Essentia water does have a smooth texture to it.  Most other bottled waters taste more crisp than this Essentia water.  Again, you may either like the smooth texture of this water or you may think that its texture is rather flat and bland.  Unlike drinking ""distilled water"", or bottled water that was purified using distillation with no additives, this water has a very slight subtle aftertaste that might be considered as either ""chalky"" or ""metallic"".  Those are my highly subjective adjectives that I associate with this water.  I can only surmise that this is due to the small amounts of additives that were used in this water.  This aftertaste is not too objectionable, but if I just want to hydrate myself drinking ""water"", I really prefer my water to be without any identifiable taste, texture, or odor.<br /><br />Next, since this is not just a bottle of pure H2O water, let's consider what was added to this water: sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride.  Sodium bicarbonate is the same thing as baking soda.  This water was made to have a slightly alkaline pH of 9.5 by adding sodium bicarbonate.  People sometimes also adjust and raise the pH of their swimming pool water by adding sodium bicarbonate.  Dipotassium phosphate is sometimes added to various food products as a buffering agent or emulsifier.  In this water, it serves as one of the ""electrolytes"" that is added.  The term ""electrolytes"" is just a subset of minerals that are found in both the Earth and the food that we eat.  Also serving as an electrolyte is the addition of magnesium sulfate.  Magnesium sulfate is sold in drug stores as ""Epsom Salt"", and you can either soak your feet or body in an Epsom Salt bath to soothe sore muscles, or when ingested in larger quantities, magnesium sulfate also can serve as a laxative.  Calcium chloride serves as another electrolyte in this water.  Calcium chloride is sometimes used as a food additive.  The trace amounts of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus in this water do not qualify as a measurable part of your daily nutritional intake of these minerals, regardless of how much of this water you drink each day.<br /><br />Essentia is definitely not the first bottled water manufacturer to add electrolytes to either bottled water or drinks.  During the 1960s, Gatorade was possibly the first large-scale commercial drink that was produced with the goal of adding electrolytes of sodium, sugar, potassium, and phosphate to hydrate and replenish athletes who lost fluids during physical exertion in hot weather.  On Essentia's Web site, they have an FAQ question/answer of: ""Why should I drink Essentia if I get my electrolytes through sports drinks?  Essentia provides a blend of dissolved minerals that emulate the ratio of the body's own mixture and concentration - providing the correct proportion of electrolytes without all the sugars and other additives you typically find in sports and energy drinks.""  There are several problems with that statement.  First, if you are actively exercising and sweating, your body can actually use those extra calories, and if you are just sitting in front of the computer or television, guzzling Gatorade just adds useless calories and electrolytes.  Second, if you are drinking Essentia at home, this product's claim that it provides ""the correct proportion of electrolytes"" implies a one-size-fits-all balance of electrolytes, which is simply not true as we all have different bodies, diets, and lifestyles.<br /><br />None of what Essentia refers to as ""Our Proprietary Technology"" is really that ""proprietary"" or exotic.  The reverse osmosis purification of municipal tap water is commonly used to produce bottled water, and the addition of various electrolytes or minerals to water has been practiced by other bottled water manufacturers for many decades now.  Some people think that drinking plain distilled water tastes boring and, mentally at least, they like the idea that drinking water that is naturally infused with minerals from a spring or well/aquifer adds an extra measure of health benefits.  The addition of trace minerals do add noticeable flavor that mimics natural spring water.  Also, slightly flavoring the water with minerals masks the residual odors that can be left by the plastic water bottle; the plastic odor is still there, but you notice it less.  The same principle applies to using a room deodorizer to mask the existing odors in a house; that old cat urine smell is still present inside the house, but you notice it less and therefore the house smells fresher.  The most common electrolytes/minerals in spring water are calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, sulfate, and chloride.  The Coca-Cola company markets a ""Dasani"" bottled water that, like this Essentia, is municipal tap water purified via reverse osmosis.  Dasani has magnesium sulfate and potassium chloride added to it.  Perhaps the Dasani taste testing panels decided that their water tastes better without the addition of calcium?  But for whatever reasons, this Essentia water has a slight residual ""chalky"" or ""metallic"" aftertaste, as if it had a tannic undertone like the aftertaste after drinking a dry red wine, that I do not really care for.  I do not want my drinking water to leave a subtle aftertaste in my mouth.<br /><br />Essentia also competes directly with ""Glaceau Smart Water"", which takes an approach similar to Essentia's water.  Glaceau Smart Water is municipal water purified via distillation, and then infused with the similar ingredients of calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, and potassium bicarbonate.<br /><br />Not to be outdone, another of Essentia's alkaline/electrolyte water competitors, named ""NEO Water"" (to ride on the futuristic coattails of ""The Matrix"" fame??), pumps out even more junk science drivel filled with fear-mongering misleading statements, calling itself ""Alkaline, Electrolyte, Antioxidant Super Hydrator ... ultra purified healthy and refreshing water formulated through proprietary technology to balance, revitalize and propel you unlike any traditional water"", and ""NEO's unique antioxidants neutralize free radicals the body releases when under exertion"".  But when you really dig further into NEO Water's claims, there are *NO* antioxidants in NEO Water... just potassium bicarbonate, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, which is similar to the mundane chemicals added to Essentia and Dasani water.  NEO Water's marketing nonsense says that its ""alkalinity allows its molecules to carry more oxygen than normal with an extra attached electron (hydroxyl ions). As a result, these molecules are able to seek and neutralize free radicals in your body and prevent free radical damage to your cells. These natural antioxidant benefits leave your body rich in oxygen and energy.""  Again, like Essentia, NEO Water hopes to blind and persuade the consumer by overwhelming you with exotic totally false techno-babble; it ascribes its antioxidant benefits entirely to its 9.5 pH alkalinity.  So if you really believe in this nonsense, you could, in theory, obtain far more amazing antioxidant protection simply by dissolving an antacid tablet into your tap water once a day.  As with Essentia's water, NEO Water's ""ultra purified"" water is simply municipal tap water purified using the common method of reverse osmosis.<br /><br />This Essentia Drinking Water is not the first product to tout the benefits of ""alkaline water"".  There have been previous highly-hyped products based on ionized water, alkaline water, and combination alkaline-ionized water.  There have even been so-called ""liquid oxygen"" drops that supposedly contained ""O4"" molecules (instead of the ""O2"" oxygen that is in the air) dissolved in a liquid, and by ingesting 10 drops each day, you feel more energized, but this quackery completely ignores the fact that oxygen is best utilized in the lungs, and not in the stomach.  Just as the ""liquid oxygen"" drops are a distorted version of twisted junk science based on the concept of oxygen bars (at least in oxygen bars, you do breathe in the oxygen instead of putting drops of useless oxygen in your stomach), this ""alkaline water"" concept is a distortion of the ""alkaline diet"" alternative medicine belief that the foods we eat can affect the acidity of urine and blood, which can then affect our well-being, susceptibility to disease, and energy level.  If you are an avid vegan/vegetarian practitioner of an alkaline diet, then this 9.5-pH alkaline water can keep your diet on its alkaline-based theme.  But if you regularly eat meats, poultry, seafood, dairy products, eggs, grains, processed sugar foods, and colas/sodas, all of which significantly boost the acidic levels of your food consumption, then drinking a slightly alkaline water makes absolutely no difference to your health.<br /><br />Your stomach has a healthily acidic pH that ranges between 1.45 to 3.5; your stomach must be very acidic to aid in digestion.  However, blood must always be slightly alkaline, with a pH of 7.35 to 7.45.  If the blood's pH drops below 6.8 (more acidic) or rises above 7.8 (more alkaline), death may occur.  But your blood automatically stays within its healthy pH range regardless of what you eat or drink because your blood utilizes several buffering systems.  The most important buffer for maintaining acidity/alkalinity balance in the blood is called the carbonic-acid-bicarbonate buffer.  To form the bicarbonate in this buffering system, your body uses carbon dioxide... guess what, carbon dioxide is in (over)abundance in the air that you breathe and you do not need sodium bicarbonate baking soda added to your drinking water to maintain a healthy pH in your body.  In fact, consuming too much supplemental sodium bicarbonate can actually lead to constipation, convulsions, diarrhea, frequent urination, and vomiting.  There is only a tiny amount of sodium bicarbonate in each bottle of Essentia water, so you do not have to worry about overdose.  But my point is that all this hoopla and hype about this water being of the ""Best Available pH at 9.5"" is purified nonsense.  Some other fear-mongering alkaline water sales gimmicks claim that, to quote another Web site, ""Excess acidity weakens all our systems and forces the body to take minerals from vital organs and bones to buffer/neutralize the acid and safely remove it from the body.""  But this is totally false fear-based junk science contrived to mislead you into thinking that your body will rob its vital organs and bones of minerals to neutralize excess acidity.  But our body's carbonic-acid-bicarbonate buffer simply combines carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air with water to make the blood plasma more acidic if it needs to, and it can prevent excess plasma acidity and raise its pH to be more alkaline by having the lungs convert the bicarbonate back into CO2 which you then breathe out.  A similar phosphate buffering system also helps to maintain the pH of cellular fluids, using phosphate instead of bicarbonate.  Phosphorus is present in nearly all foods, and regardless of whether you like to eat lots of meats or lots of vegetables, you can get plenty of sufficient phosphorus in your diet without needing to add it to your drinking water!<br /><br />Drinking too many acidic drinks such as sodas and colas can have a detrimental effect of eroding your tooth enamel, but guzzling all those colas have absolutely no effect on the pH of your cells and bodily fluids.  And regardless of how much alkalinity you consume and put in your stomach, your body is going to make sure that your stomach stays within a healthy acidic pH range and your body will use its pH buffering systems to keep your blood pH between 7.35 and 7.45 regardless of how much acidic or alkaline food and drink you consume. If you are familiar with logarithms, also realize that the pH scale is logarithmic (pH is not a linear scale) and drinking 9.5 pH water really has no effect on your various bodily fluids compared with drinking tap water or any other bottled water. And if you really could somehow artifically adjust your stomach, blood, and bodily fluids entirely to a 9.5 pH, you would be immediately wheeled into a hospital's emergency room because your body and its stomach cannot handle that kind of alkalinity.<br /><br />If you suffer from frequent heartburn or acid reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease), drinking this 9.5 pH water will NOT help the least bit.  Your stomach acids need to constantly stay very acidic to maintain proper digestive functions, and the slight alkalinity of this water has no effect on the stomach acid that is entering into the esophagus of people with GERD.<br /><br />Trying to market bottled water based on its ""silky smooth taste"" and ""hydrates better"" claims, its over-hyped ""9.5 pH"" attribute, and all its overexaggerated health claims constitute marketing trickery to fool consumers by utilizing the ""if you believe that it can really work, it does indeed work"" placebo effect.  The placebo effect is a very powerful phenomenon that can frequently affect everything from clinical trials of pharmacological substances to faith healing.  Basically, if you have a hopeful mindset of expectancy and conditioning that makes you think that something will work, then that perception can become 100% of your subjectively observed reality and outcome of the treatment.  For examples of other placebo effects: If I told you that you can get stronger bones by breathing milk through your nose instead of drinking it through your mouth, or if I told you that you could be revitalized by just holding broccoli in your hands for two minutes every day instead of eating it, if you really believe or hope that to be true, then after breathing the milk into your nose or holding the broccoli in your hands, you may think to yourself, ""Gee, I feel better, stronger, and more energetic after having done that!""  Likewise, if you really HOPE to feel more hydrated after drinking this Essentia water, you may actually feel more refreshed simply because you BELIEVE that this water is hydrating you better than drinking other sources of water, when in fact the tap water from your faucet could have hydrated you just as refreshingly.<br /><br />The Amazon 'Product Description' for this Essentia water falsely states even more overexaggerated health claims: ""Essentia Water provides unmatched hydration, health benefits and smooth taste.  Its superior hydrating qualities come from a special electrolyte formula and optimal pH level of 9.5, which gives your body more of what it needs to thrive.  Drinking Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system and helps bring your body back into balance.  It also helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more.""  Again... these claims are way wayyyy overexaggerated!  Compared to your overall health, fitness level, and daily food diet, the trace minerals found in this water and this water's slight alkalinity really make no difference in boosting the ""antioxidant properties of your immune system"", nor does it ""help maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more"".  With this litany of false health claims, I am surprised that they also did not pile on claims that this water ""increases libido, cures erectile dysfunction, grows hair on balding men, makes women sexy, and fixes the national debt"" too.<br /><br />Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:<br /><br />I must admit that I personally do not regularly purchase bottled water for home use, even though I will sometimes buy it while I am away from home, both because I think that filtering my tap water through a Brita filter produces water that is just as tasty and healthy as bottled water and, just as important, I think that too much plastic (and petroleum) is used in the production of bottled water and most plastic bottles end up in our overflowing landfills.  Roughly 1.5 million tons of plastic is used to make water bottles.  And this does not include the energy used to make the plastic and the oil used for transporting all the bottled water.  It takes about two liters of water used during the production process just to make one liter of bottled water.  So behind each 1-liter bottle of water is another two liters of water that was expended during its production.  Essentia states that their plastic bottles are ""safe and recyclable"", but we can all reduce our carbon footprint if we drink less bottled water.  In many developing countries, tap water is either unavailable or unsafe, making bottled water a better option if residents cannot boil their tap water before consumption.  But here in the U.S., some bottled water manufacturers, including this Essentia bottled water, use fear-based advertising claims that their water is healthier than tap water, which it really is not.  The concerns for the taste of tap water are valid, however, especially with tap water that has residual smell or taste of chlorination.  But residual smells and taste issues can be easily and economically remedied by using various activated charcoal/carbon filters at home to treat your tap water.  Anyway, the tap water that comes out of my faucet at home is also slightly alkaline like this Essentia water, and many municipal water supplies are also slightly alkaline, so there is no need to purchase this bottled water that has baking soda added to it.<br /><br />This is not a bad bottled water.  It is priced competitively with other bottled waters.  But it has an odd aftertaste that I do not like.  And the techno-jargon claims that revolve around this water's selling points - 9.5 pH, ""ionically separated water"", ""Infused With Electrolytes"", and even falsely stating that this water boosts your immune system - amount to nothing but purified snake oil hogwash.  To quote William Shakespeare, all this marketing hype about 9.5 pH and electrolytes is really ""much ado about nothing""!",Neutral

455521,B005HG9ERW,5,Ph Balanced Water,"There are a few things that I look for in a bottled drinking water.  One is oxygenation which a few bottled water companies put out.  Pente water is my favorite of this kind (and has stabilized medicinal grade oxygen).  Oxygen tends to alkalize.  Two is a Ph balanced water.  Essentia is my favorite one of these.  I find that I drink the whole bottle very quickly, because it satisfies a need.  The body likes the balance that it gives.  It helps rehydrate and for the body to remove toxins.  One of the curious ways that this shows up is that when I drink a ph balanced water, I tend to go to the bathroom very soon afterwards (and you can tell from the urine color and from how much the urine ""bubbles"" that it is removing toxins).  It seems to move through the body quicker.  When my father needed to alkalize, I had recommended that he take Pente water.  But he could not find it where he was and he stumbled on Essentia water and found it worked for him and got similar results to Pente water.  I got a bottle of the Essentia water from the Amazon review program partly because it had worked for my father.  I could taste the difference, taste the minerals that made it more alkaline.  It felt slightly thicker than regular water and slightly smoother.  I drank up the whole 1.5 liter bottle within less than an hour because it felt like it was satisfying a need inside me.  If I had to choose, I would probably still pick some Pente water over the Essentia water, because the oxygen still alkalizes and has other benefits from the oxygen itself.  But Essentia would be my second choice.  If I was stocking up, however, I would get both of them.  My guess is that there different approaches to alkalizing would make them complimentary.",Positivo
455661,B005HG9ERW,3,It's water.,"On the bottle's label is the statement ""Doctor recommended to protect, improve and enhance the quality of your health."" The vagueness of that statement--does it mean that one doctor recommended Essentia as opposed to any other water? Or perhaps that doctors in general acknowledge what everyone knows, namely that water is essential to life?--amused me. There are a variety of claims on the label and at Essentia's website (including a testimonial by a ""Dr. G.N."" from Wisconsin), but it turns out that Essentia is just municipal tap water that's gone through a variety of processes designed, apparently, to provide electrolytes and improve hydration.<br /><br />I'm not in a position to judge these claims, though having reading books such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GAN3G4"">Bottlemania</a> and seen shows such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00019PDNY"">Penn & Teller's</a> show about bottled water, I am somewhat dubious of claims regarding bottled water. So I did an informal test. I filled three bottles with water: one with this product, one with simple tap water from my kitchen sink, and one with purified water from a generic brand. I put the three bottles into the refrigerator (with little pieces of paper taped to the bottom indicating the source), and shuffled them every day for two weeks until I was--or believe I was--unaware of the provenance of each bottle's contents.<br /><br />The results: A virtual dead heat. I could tell that one of the bottles (the Essentia, as it turned out) was slightly different. There was a slight aftertaste. It wasn't unpleasant, just there. But before I looked at the identities, I did rank the bottles. Tap water won. Essentia was second. And the purified water was third. Oddly, it tasted rather plastic and was the only one that did so despite the fact that all of the bottles were identical. (They were empty bottles of that same water.)<br /><br />In the end, though, I noticed no benefits of superior hydration or the additives. I simply tasted water that was slightly different from two others. Of course, my test wasn't scientific. It wasn't double-blind, though I tried hard to make it as close as possible. It represents, for what it's worth, my experience.",Neutral

467958,B005HUVI0Y,1,Caribou Pulls a Fast One on Loyal Customers,"I've been drinking Caribou Blend for years and it is just right for my taste... or at least it was. Got a new shipment in and I noticed a color change on the K-cup, orange to light green. Uh-oh, wrong product? I compared the box to my old one and found the same SKU number but the roast level has been dropped from medium to very light along with the color change. My taste test revealed exactly that... a mild, relatively tasteless coffee more like their dishwater Daybreak than the old Caribou blend. Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed. Sounds to me, the skeptic, that perhaps they have been forced to switch to a cheaper coffee with less gusto and more bitterness to maintain their competitive price points. How sad. I would have gladly paid more for my favorite. The new blend is far inferior. If you're a regular, have someone brew both and I bet you'll have no problem distinguishing the difference. Time for a new favorite with a company that doesn't play sleazy tricks on its loyal customers.

She liked it by itself and had no trouble with it for the first few days. Then her poops starting turning really loose and she wouldn't touch it anymore. I tried transitioning onto two more super premium foods with the same results before I realized what the culprit was: one ingredient, flaxseed. All of the foods she had trouble with had it. The one super premium I finally found that she didn't have trouble with didn't have it. Flaxseed is known for greasing the chute so if your cat doesn't have problems in that area that ingredient might not be for you. It's amazing how many super premium brands have that ingredient prominently featured, which means I can't use them. Pity, as otherwise this food is very appealing: texture is dense but soft, the smell reminds me of Campbell's Condensed Chicken Soup (not unappealing for some of us) and the cat obviously liked the flavor before the inevitable reaction overcame it.

It gave me a chance to test these out in several ways.<br /><br />1. Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br /><br />2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br /><br />There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br /><br />All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br /><br />As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br /><br />Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.

From my standpoint, you would need to use a minimum of two of these per cup of coffee. And that would probably have to be demitasse size to have it taste worthwhile. There also was none of that wonderful coffee aroma that you get with a good coffee.<br /><br />To make matters worse, there are no instructions on the box to tell you how much to use. I wasn't sure if it was my drip coffeemaker or not, but my guess is that the water would have to soak like a teabag.

Forget 5 Stars this product deserves 7 Stars for exceeding expectations for 16 ounces of liquid gold.  I used to make sauces like this at home and it is a chore usually only fine restaurants take the time and effort to make.  Making this Classic French Brown Sauce from scratch will take you at least 24 hours with many reduction stages and you start with a 20 quart stock pot, 14 lbs of sawed veal and beef bones and 14 hours gently simmering on the stove. Skim and strain and then further reductions.  If you have a fine restaurant then this is required but if you are a home chef/cook then make life easy and reach for the jar.<br /><br />I love this little jar which is a very thick reduction, a concentrate.  I mainly use it as a sauce and will cut it with 3-4 parts of water depending on my use so you can see a little of this can go a long way and is not expensive at all.  It is a great value.  You can use it in many different ways to up the level of you cooking and your dinner guests will be pleased...even the 7 year olds.  I've been told I make the best ""gravy"" in the world.<br /><br />Here ya go the ingredients say it all:  Veal Stock (Veal Bones, Water), Beef Stock, Mirepoix Stock (Made of Carrot, Celery, and Onion Stocks), Red Wine, Tomato Paste, Gelatin, Salt, Carrot Stock, Celery Stock.

ZERO STARS,"We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products.

I've never been one to like the smell of dog food, but I certainly didn't find the smell to be any more offensive than any other food like the other reviewer mentioned. I actually placed out a piece of 3 different types of food in front of my dog and she immediately whe went for the Hills Science Diet Ideal Balance food, so I'm guessing that she found it to be more appealing too. Although I haven't seen a HUGE improvement on her reflux issue, it has seemed to helped a bit and I'll take any help I can at this point. In fact, she's only been on the diet a few weeks now, and I know it generally takes a bit longer for it's full effects, so I'm very optimistic that it will provide even more improvement in the future. The only negatives I have about the food are that I had a hard time opening the bag and the top actually ripped open so I wasn't able to use the reasealable closure (but that could've been due to my impatience), and it seems to be a bit pricey. BUT, it's worth it for the quality and if it helps. Definitely would recommend! I am a buzzagent and did receive a free 4 lb bag and coupons to try the product.",Positivo

They don't assume they know if the product is okay for my daughter or not.  They give me the facts and the numbers and let me make my own decision.  Larabar did NOT give me a clear answer.  They gave me a very vague answer assuring me that they went through stringent testing but they did not say what kind of testing.  They also said their products met the FDA requirements for gluten free which is so BOGUS b/c the FDA currently does not have any sort of requirements or enforcements for gluten free labels.  They are proposing implementing one but have not yet done so.  So Larabar is attempting to deceive me.  They also did not answer my question if gluten was also processed in the facilities that process Larabars.  Again, most other companies answer me directly on this and are very helpful.

I ALWAYS eat breakfast but for some reason the morning after my first shot, I had no desire for it. I don't know what caused that. Also, it took away that exciting feeling I get when I snack.

Turkey 101 is fairly inexpensive mass market hooch and I've been tasting top drawer stuff lately.  How would it hold up?  Quite well, as you will see:<br /><br />Color in the glass:  medium bronze-amber.<br /><br />Toffee fruity sherry nose w/ salted roasted peanut note.  With more time the fruit takes on a meaty quality - bacon.  There's more grape sherry or Madeira notes too.  There's also a solvent note that carries burnt rubber. With even more time I get a bit more burnt rubber to go with the roast peanut, bacon, and Madeira cocktail.  I like that it's distinctive and unique.  I could learn to love it, but it's not the aroma profile I would have said I wanted in advance.<br /><br />Entry is toffee sweet and richly honeyed with an immediate drying midpalate. Peppery with a beer-like tang of herbs with a bitter edge like hops and a whiff of smoke (that is oddly absent in the finish).  Theres a kiss of vanilla after extra airing and some of that nice sherry flavor too. Sweet then off dry with herbal notes.  I've been seeing that lately with fancier offerings like Woodford and 4 Roses single barrel.  I suspect its a higher rye balance in the mashbill.<br /><br />Finish is long and spare with spirit heat beer malt and hops echo.  Elegant, lean, surprisingly drinkable with an interesting and varied flavor profile.

If you think you'll get them sooner than what they say...don't count on it.<br />The main reason for the 3 stars though, is because inside the green pods(hence the name) are supposed to be a clumop of little black seeds. Well over 60% of the pods I got had clumps of little tan seeds. Not sure if they weren't ripe or just weren't cardamom. I do know that there are a lot of fake products out there, and with such a high percentage of the wrong color seeds, it made me doubt the entire delivery.<br />With that doubt I can't justify a better rating.

496660,B005HG9ET0,3,Eh.It's Water,"There's no doubt that water will taste quite different from source to source, but for the most part, unless you live in a town with a high sulfur or arsenic concentration, you don't NEED bottled water. A good PUR, Brita or Zero Water filter should be enough. So no one actually needs to PURCHASE Essentia. That said, if you're on a long car ride or visiting another country, bottled water makes sense. Essentia is a high pH water (on the base side. Low would be acidic and you wouldn't want to drink it). It tastes...okay. I've have better and I've had worse. It's a little pricer than most bottled water, but I'm happy that it is Electrolyte infused and that the bottles are BPA and Phthalate free. That makes Essentia a better choice than Aquavita or even Fiji which has a massively high carbon footprint.<br /><br />All in all, it's water. I can't say I'd go out of my way for this as I'd prefer to get Smartwater for my electrolyte enchanced h20 (better tasting), but I'd pick this up over a lot of the more common mass produced, secretly just tap water brands.",Neutral

Taste is, of course, personal, and to me this water tastes like tap water!<br />I just used it in my water bottle during a run, and can't say I noticed any increased endurance on my usual course.<br />All that said, with Amazon Prime, a dozen 1-1/2 liter bottles can be delivered to your door, without additional shipping charges, for less than $30., which would be a reasonable price for ordinary tap water, so there's no reason not to choose Essentia, so long as you don't have unreasonable expectations for its health benefits.",Neutral

496851,B005HG9ET0,3,Water-flavoured alkaline electrolyte beverage.,"Essentia is water with electrolytes and a pH of 9.5. It is basically an alkaline unflavoured sports drink.  Essentia tastes just like regular water; it's not soapy, nor metallic tasting like some would suspect looking at the 9.5 pH label.<br /><br />The whole alkaline water discussion falls into 2 camps that is really beyond the scope of this review.  To summarize, one camp believes it helps against cancer, and promotes longevity etc by following an alkaline diet, the other is calling BS on the psuedoscience of creating ""pure"" alkaline water through osmosis and ionizing water. There is also a large number of middle-of-the-road people that are just using it for convenience to help with GERD instead of popping a pepcid or carrying around a box of bicarb.<br /><br />One important note is that this water is sourced from many sources (including municipal) and is treated water, which does rank lower than water sourced from a natural untreated and untampered spring.  However, Essentia does taste good and whatever other people's stance is on the alkaline water/diet issue, it can't hurt to just drink more water.<br /><br />I love water.

I don't understand how it can recommend only a few drops though- for one, it takes about 20x that amount to actually get any flavor in the drink! For another, one of my biggest issues with these Mio things is that I can't get it to do a ""drop"". You squeeze it until it shoots out as a jet. I haven't managed to get it to just do a ""drop"". The peach flavor is a bit strong in comparison to the mango, and definitely is that artificial candy-type peach, not real peach flavor.

This is an issue if you are giving this to kids to use.<br />In Europe they make ""koolaid"" with concentrated sugar solutions.  I always thought that was a great idea, as you can control the amount of sweetness.  This is an artificial sweetener version of the same idea. It gives a sweet, light taste to the water.

It does help mask that nasty aftertaste.  I will get a different flavor for him (peach is not his thing) to bring on camping trips to mask the flavor of iodine.  I will be happy to do that, because he hates the taste of the iodine so much that I worry he will become dehydrated on these trips.  Its small enough to not add too much weight to his backpack.<br /><br />Diabetics (or dieters):<br />This is great for those who need to watch sugar intake and who will not drink plain water.  Plain water would certainly be healthier, but if that is not an option, this will help.<br /><br />Convenience:<br /> I used to bring koolaid one packs (the kind that flavor one bottle of water) into amusement parks etc so that the kids could have something besides water to drink (no soda allowed because of braces).

It's a 70/30 robusta/arabica blend, a dark roast with a fruity though noticeably bitter finish (but not as bad as Starbucks or Peet's coffee). The Lavazza Espresso (black tin, 100% arabica claimed) tastes better than this blend, but after having tried Illy's moka grind, the different blends from Lavazza, Kimbo, Segafredo, and also blends from the local coffee roasters, I actually think that a robusta/arabica blend works best for a moka pot; just not this one. Overall, I'd say that I got what I paid for, but I didn't get what I wanted and I was seduced by the 93 or so 4/5 star reviews for this coffee.

Lipton's Iced Green Tea Mix really is more like Kool-Aid fruit punch. For my tasting preference, a 20 oz bottle of water is not enough water for one of these packets. I ended up using half of a packet for 20 oz of water. Using more water with the packet brings out the tea in the drink which is normally hidden by the sugar sweetness in the 20oz water.<br />If Lipton calms down the sweetness level in the packet I would definitely purchase again.

Sometimes you get a burned piece.<br /><br />(2) The price (over $1 per bar) is really too high for 1/2 ounce of cheese.

A great serving size is 20-30 half-dollar sized parmesan bites/crisps, on a normal sized baking pan. A toaster oven or convection oven is best - it makes fewer servings, but will crisp faster (3-4 minutes on 400-450).

513074,B001E6EE4C,4,It ain't your old-fashioned cardboard!,"Fiber One Honey Clusters accomplishes something most other fiber-laden foods don't: It has flavour!<br /><br />I was originally turned on to this cereal by a nutritional website's ranking of top cereals.  Compared to other ""ultra-healthy"" cereals like the original Fiber One it may not be the healthiest but it's a nice compromise to get a little sweetness out of your ""grown-up"" food while still providing some very worthwhile health & nutritional benefits.<br /><br />I don't know that any kids are going to be begging their parents for this because it obviously doesn't have all the sweetness of super-sugary cereals, but it also doesn't taste like cardboard and for those of us grown-ups who still have a bit of a sweet tooth, it fills the bill.  (If you want to add a bit of extra flavour, try it with Vanilla Silk soy milk.)<br /><br />Also, if you're the type of person for whom a single bowl of cereal doesn't cut it hunger-wise, this may have you singing a different tune in your morning shower.  Foods high in fiber give you a greater sense of being full so naturally this cereal should be able to keep you satisfied until your next meal.<br /><br />One word of caution though: For those of you who have not consumed high-fiber foods or taken Metamucil as a supplement before, start small and work your way up.  It's not uncommon to experience some uncomfortable digestive consequences if you try to take in too much fiber all at once without giving your body time to adjust.  In the long-term, though, fiber is obvisouly a fantastic way to keep your digestion in tip-top shape.<br /><br />Since Amazon only sells cereal in bulk, I always recommend taste-testing a single box at your local grocery.

They're small (though I still cut them in half when I'm not feeling lazy), perfect size for a quick training treat so that your dog can be rewarded but his attention stays on you (rather than on eating the treat).<br /><br />I like the texture.  They are moist but not wet so there is no sticky residue.<br /><br />The price is good.<br /><br />The ingredients are ok.  Not great, despite the ""natural"" claim, but I don't necessarily expect treats to be healthy.<br /><br />But, and it's a big but, they stink to high heaven.  In fact, they stink so bad that I have to hold my breath whenever I open the bag, otherwise I will truly gag.  I can't describe the smell but despite the ""natural"" ingredients, they smell nothing like what you would find in nature.  These treats have been so highly processed that the original ingredients are beyond recognition.<br /><br />Actually, the smell reminds me of kibble.  I haven't fed my dogs kibble in over a decade, but whenever we dogsit and I get a whiff of our friends' dogs' kibble, I want to gag too.  But the smell of Zuke's is at least 6 times stronger.  I hate how the odor lingers on my fingers after I've handled the treats.<br /><br />In fact, for a couple of days, while working at my desk, I would get a strong whiff of what smelled like crab.  I had eaten a whole crab a couple of weeks ago and kept smelling my clothes, thinking that the crab smell hadn't washed out.  But my clothes smelled clean.  It wasn't until a couple of days later that I discovered the origin of that crabby smell.  It was coming from a treat pouch I had put the Zuke's in and had left on the far corner of my desk about 4 feet away.  If laundering doesn't remove that smell, I'm going to have to toss that pouch.<br /><br />I feed raw green tripe to my dogs on a regular basis, and while some have likened the smell of that to sewage, I don't actually find the odor too offensive.  Certainly isn't pretty but not enough to make me want to vomit.  Zuke's actually makes me want to do that.  It's unfortunate that they stink so much to me, because I would buy more otherwise.  However, I will say that the 1 possible benefit of their intense odor is that it does get the dogs' attention and they don't seem to mind it.<br /><br />But I guess I'll go back to making my own treats.  Chicken/turkey heart or liver, cut up into pieces, then boiled.  Pat dry, then stick in oven on low until dehydrated.

My cat thought they were just okay, and would eat them if i put them in front of her, but not come running as she does for her other treats. So I would leave them out for her in her dish, and they would get hard real quick. After maybe eating 20 of the little pieces total, she stopped eating them altogether.<br />Then I went to Petco after adopting a puppy, and Petco convinced me they would be perfect for training so i got the ones for dogs. I thought maybe the shipping made them stale, and Petco assured me the ones for dogs were of better quality. Unfortunately this was not the case, my dog who eats shoes, and ANYTHHING else that's on the floor does not want to eat these. I mean they are okay but barely okay. When I take her on walks and use them to redirect her attention and they are hard by the time we get home from our walk, and she will spit out over half of them on the sidewalk.

521122,B008ATDIDE,3,I'm Just Not Addicted...,"With so many other glowing reviews, I feel a little ashamed to put my own lukewarm review in.  Kashi GoLean Crunch! has 7 whole grains in it, which means puffed rice is mixed with oats and rye and other grains to make clusters.  It's naturally sweetened, which is a plus, and it definitely stays crunchy in milk.  Really, really crunchy.  It has sort of a sweet, oat-slightly-nutty flavor to it, and it's not bad.<br /><br />However, as I said, I'm not really addicted to it.  I prefer Back to Nature Granolas, and as I wrote this review, I became curious as to their nutrition facts.  So here is the Kashi measured up against the Back to Nature All-Natural Granola, Apple Blueberry, 15-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6) - measured by 1/2 cup servings.  There are definitely more calories in BTN (200 vs. 95), but there's fruit too, which the Kashi GoLean lacks.  BTN has slightly less sugar (6 g to Kashi's 6.5g), less salt (20 mg to 47.5 mg) and there's more protein in it (6 g to Kashi's 4.5g). They are equal in the following categories: dietary fiber (4g) and calcium (2%); there's more fat in BTN (2.5g=4% BTN, 1.5g=2.5% Kashi).  So there is not a lot of difference between the two.<br /><br />But as for the taste and the texture?  I'd readily take granola any day over the Kashi.  I don't like overly crunchy cereals (why buy a cereal specifically named, ""Crunch!"" right?) and the granola is crisp enough for me.  There are fewer sharp edges to stab me in the gums.",Neutral

Herbal tea (which actually contains no tea at all) generally has larger pieces of the ingredients than traditional black or green teas. The pyramid shape of the tea bag allows those pieces more room to spread through the water so the infusion of flavor is stronger.<br /><br />The Blackberry Vanilla tea is a beautiful purple color which is actually from the hibiscus not the blackberry (although I'm sure the blackberry does contribute some of the color). Despite the name the hibiscus is also the dominate flavor which is true of most herbal infusions.

I/D was also more expensive than Newman's at my local vet's office. I have had a ton of issues getting my dog to accept other dog foods in the past. We tried pretty much every brand that you can buy in pet shops and always had problems with my dog scratching or having her ears get bright red. We found out the problem after one of the cases where she almost went into renal failure after eating her Milkbone treats. We needed something organic without a lot of beef in it. While this one does have some bi-product for protein, it doesn't seem to bother my dog at all. She also has normal stools every time which wasn't the case even with the I/D. My dog hated the I/D. She would often leave a good portion of it on the ground or in the bowl and rarely ate it in its entirety. With the Newman's own it is night and day. She scarfs it down in less than a couple minutes and usually eats a bowl in one sitting. It seems like she loves it from the way she eats it.<br /><br />A couple of the reports from reviewers originally scared me about the reports of scratching which was exactly the problem I had with other dog foods. I gave it a try and my husky has never had a problem since and she has been on it for almost three months now. My husky has always had problems with digestive issues and this seems to be one dog food that she likes and does not have problems with.<br /><br />On a side note, I wish Newman's offered a bigger size bag. I have to order these all the time due to the 12.5 pound bag. My husky kills a bag in roughly two weeks due to her size. It still works out being cheaper than the $50 bag of 17 pound I/D I was ordering so I'm still happy with it. Science diet was sending me to the poor house.",Positivo

535932,B003VXHGDM,3,Unremarkable,"First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG"">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.",Neutral

But they are super hard and chewy (much more so than normal) and appear to have been exposed to high heat, like they melted a bit at some point.  I've got to admit that I never looked at the expiration date on one that I've bought at a mini mart, but that's probably because they've never been stale or given me cause to question the freshness. As it turns out, the case I have now was delivered in September 2012 and expires in October 2013, so they should be fine. Hopefully, this was just a fluke and the next case will be better.  If not, they're getting returned and I'll find another source.

While having a meat, whether it be chicken or fish or duck or whatever, is the easiest way to separate good from great it doesn't always show which is the best.  Pound for pound, you want as little grains as possible with the highest concentration of proteins for your active pet.  This formula is great because the first ingredient is CHICKEN MEAL.  Meal yields more protein then a first ingredient simply stated chicken.  I used Iam's Mini chunks before but after a recommendation from a breeder, I use Pro Pac for both my extremely active dogs.  They love it and I love the price.  Not only that, I know I am giving my dogs the best dog food for their nutritional needs.  On top of that....every 10th bag is free.",Positivo

543485,B006MONQMC,3,Wasn't bad,"I am a really big fan of these squeeze drinks for water and I have to say that this one isn't that bad at all. The taste is a very mild fruit punch unless you squeeze a lot into your glass, and overall the flavor really isn't that bad. Sweet, yet mellow but it definitely isn't your normal fruit punch flavor. For it does remind me of a more childlike or even a more watered down and less sugar added HiC pouches I use to drink in middle school. Yet for people you want something different then the normal water this adds something plus I do enjoy the fact that it does hold a little bit of a vitamin energy to help get you through the day. I was squeezing this into my water bottle and taking it on the go when I go out to work out and had found that it helps keep me hydrated and even a little energized.<br /><br />I have to recommend these type of drinks for people who are tired of just regular water, would like to get some extra vitamin's when a water adder but I do wish the taste could be more improved and that there are clear directions on exactly how much a squeeze is really needed.

It was already sweet to me.<br /><br />I wish they would provide info about caffeine, how much in 1 tablespoon or anything so I would know how much I drink (being pregnant).

So frustrating.  On the positive side, it is tasty, reminds me of Kool Aid or Hi C, and I am glad that it does not contain aspartame. With this type of ""sports/energy"" drink, however, I do prefer actual sugar to feed my body while I am walking/running/hiking/working out.  (Sucralose is the sweetener used in this product.) The caffeine is a mild boost, 40mg per ""squeeze.""  You can adjust the squeeze to use as much or as little as you'd like, according to your taste and water bottle size (provided that your Vitamin Squeeze bottle is not defective).",Negativo
543839,B006MONQMC,3,Tastes like Crystal Light,"I used to buy Crystal Light all the time, the kind that had vitamins and stuff in it, and this tastes like the citrus or tropical or something fruit punch flavor which I rather like. I gave up Crystal Light a long time ago in favor of water, I figure who needs to be consuming sucralose, but lately I've been making these concoctions of vitamin C powder and/or MSM powder, the juice of a few limes, some liquid stevia and sometimes an Ester-C packet and I thought I could add this in place of the Ester-C and the stevia and then I'd have a tasty beverage WITH caffeine in it but still with the vitamins.<br />So, I made my concoction this way, and it tasted fine. The one thing I was unsure about was the serving size. The bottle says ""one squeeze"", and I think a squeeze could end up being quite a lot of the bottle if you were quite zealous about it. The side of the bottle says that a serving is 1/2 ounce, which I originally calculated as two tablespoons, but on further reflection I realized my math must be off and it's one tablespoon, but originally I put two tablespoons in 8 oz of water and it tasted about the right strength to me, so that's about how much I was using. I'd think with one tablespoon it would be a bit weak, but this means I only got 12 servings out of my bottle and not 24.<br />Compared to my usual concoction, a glass of this stuff has almost no vitamin C. It does have 120% of the RDA, but compared to what I usually have that is laughably little. It also says it has 40mg of caffeine in a serving, so I tried drinking a bunch of it in an afternoon, but it didn't make me feel a caffeine buzz or anything.<br />Anyway, I've used almost all the bottle and won't be seeking it out when it's gone. The flavor is basically good but I'm not into all that sucralose, artificial color and it kind of rubs me the wrong way that it says ""each squeeze into water adds more flavor and nutrition"". Like it's some kind of health food product or something. Ooooh...nutritious! Why have fruits and vegetables when you can just have vitamin squeeze energy drink!?",Neutral
543840,B006MONQMC,3,This would be a great product if it had no caffeine.,"This product is very easy to use. Just squeeze into your water. I like that you can control the amount of sweetness. If you like your drinks sweeter, just add a bit more. The fruit punch flavor tastes just like Kool-Aid's fruit punch flavor. It is zero calories. One serving is one squeeze. It contains 24 servings per 12 ounce bottle.<br /><br />Each serving contains:<br />40 mg CAFFEINE<br />Vitamin C  120%<br />Vitamin B6  40%<br />Vitaimin B5  40%<br />Vitamin B3  40%<br />Vitamin B12  40%<br />Chromium  10%<br /><br />Once the bottle is opened it does need to be refrigerated. It also says that it should be used within 30 days after opening.<br /><br />The sweetener used in this product is sucralose.<br /><br />I think a big drawback of this product it that there are 40mg of caffeine per serving. I try to limit the amount of caffeine in my diet, so this product is not something I will be using again. Also, this makes it something I would avoid giving to kids.",Neutral

557520,B003YBLF2E,2,I think somethings missing....,"Okay, I like where they are going with this idea - prepackaging a healthy snack of unusual dishes for people with little time.  Here is where it went wrong.<br /><br />1) I read the box, and it tells me how healthy the meal is, including lots of fiber<br />2) I open the box<br />3) I notice that there are no utensils, and that the chocolate is missing.<br />4) I find a knife for spreading and open the salmon<br />5) I gag from the overwhelming odor of the fish and dispose of the salmon after a quick taste (not to my liking)<br />6) I discover peanuts in the granola mix - I like peanuts but didn't remember seeing any warnings on the box about peanuts<br />7) I liked the edemame but the bag was too small<br />8) I realized how much garbage was created from a little midget snack and feel bad for my planet.  For real everything was individually wrapped in plastic and the portions were so small that odds are people will STILL go find more to eat.<br /><br />In the end, my box was missing things, there didn't seem to be any way to spread the salmon included, I wouldn't advise eating this at your desk because of the pungent odor and there are better packaging choices for the environment.<br /><br />Now if I could find a big bag of that edemame I would buy THAT, but there was too much trash for too little reward in this ""snack"" for me.",Negativo
557586,B003YBLF2E,3,Not too big and not too tasty,"If I had to sum up what I though of ""GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Salmon + Crackers,"" I would probably say that it is an adult form of the popular ""lunchables"" that were easy-to-make lunches for kids to take to school with them.  This is about the same size as those kid's lunches, which means that it's probably not going to fill an adult up and is therefore not really to be considered a meal.  It's a pretty in-depth snack to take on a hike or even to just eat at home if you need to nibble; and it contains 22g protein, 11g fiber, and 410 calories.  However, it's not the tastiest food in the world, and I'm not sure that I actually liked it all that much.<br /><br />The box has a tab that will pull in order to open the box, and inside you will find the following: a plastic fork, a plastic container of salmon spread, a package containing six crackers, a mini bag of a fruit/nut trail mix, a mini bad of dry roasted soy beans (edamame), and a square of chocolate.  I personally didn't even use the fork since I found it better to use a knife to spread the salmon with.  As for the salmon's taste...it was fishy with a hint of citrus.  I appreciate good salmon, but this was not good, in my opinion.  The crackers were delicious, though (how can you ruin those?).  I didn't like the roasted soy beans either; they were like burnt sunflower seeds with a peanut texture.  As for the fruit/nut trail mix, it contained very few banana chips, cranberries, and peanuts.  They were all covered with a layer of sugar, which, of course, made them delicious.  The chocolate was divine, as well, but the square was very, very small.  Another thing to note is that on the inside of the box, there are some interesting facts and a sudoku puzzle.<br /><br />Overall, I would just have to say that I personally like the layout of this product but not so much the ingredients.  I would love to try another type such as the steak nuggets or turkey pepperoni, but I will not be buying this one again.  I would definitely encourage you to try the other types of the GoPicnic series, but I just can't recommend this one.",Neutral

Then I looked at the product description. $15 for only ONE 1-lb bag!!  I doubled and tripled checked the description.  I had hoped it would be for at least 3 bags.  Is the price set so high because of the ""free shipping""? At a Trader Joe's store these sell for $3.69 per bag.  (in 2012)  What a rip-off!  I would never pay over $11 more per bag for this, or any treat.  If the price actually includes shipping and handling, then let's not call it ""free shipping.""

The description on this seemed to be a nice combo of the two.... the 2 in 1 (shampoo and conditioner) of the Head & Shoulders along with the tea tree element of the Paul Mitchell. Trouble is it seems to be much closer to the very inexpensive Head & Shoulders and not in the Paul Mitchell ball park for me.  It didn't have the tingle of the Paul Mitchell when using and there is no fragrance attached so it was similar to the bland Head & Shoulders product.

When the box arrived the first thing I noticed, right on the front of the box, was that each of the six individually wrapped cookies contains a whopping 170 calories. When I was a super active kid I ate my grandmother's cookies with impunity although I did not know the calorie count. I was always a skinny kid regardless of what I ate. Now, as an adult, I am no longer skinny but not a lard butt either and I do not aspire to become one by eating these cookies. However, I wanted to do a taste test so I took a bite and quickly realized that these are simply run of the mill oatmeal cookies. They have no distinguishing characteristics other than the major calorie count. Dry, stale and tasteless are the best descriptions I can come up with.",Neutral
